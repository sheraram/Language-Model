16.056295447257902
When used preventively, it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money.
  18.113465856983286
I have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in 1993, especially as the Commission and Parliament did not want any derogations even then.
  13.34600609297713
Seven million workers were affected and specific sectors, such as the mobile worker sector, have been subject to ruinous competition over recent years, especially in Germany.
  19.91875299213767
It is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough, Mr Crowley, to use tachographs or other technical aids.
  10.594750086931446
One does not exclude the other.
  16.242298853855242
We also need a framework directive, because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now.
  26.711908823169466
They had no rules, they were not covered by a collective agreement, they were exploited and some also engaged in self-exploitation.
  18.06226034913279
We know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems.
  9.632667595965238
Parliament has shown sufficient flexibility; Mrs Smet highlighted our legislative maturity.
  14.905076772124065
I think, Mrs Smet, you have proven that we can also fight.
  9.496280390028982
The results are acceptable.
  9.18485247042464
I am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to.
  9.896093582549007
But the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the Council.
  11.012255998426573
I hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am counting on constructive competition between the Member States to see which State will be the first to implement the proposals from Parliament and the Commission.
  16.086901203267285
Directive 93/104 was already very restrictive as far as worker production is concerned.
  14.491552744996282
It does not harmonise social legislation upwards, quite the opposite.
  15.21931333423865
It establishes a European framework which falls a long way short of workers' expectations: an 11-hour daily rest period, a 48-hour working week, a 24-hour weekly break.
  27.576446858813725
What is more, a number of categories were excluded from its field of competence.
  10.836053019921243
We find the compromise, which Parliament is to vote on today following the meetings of the Conciliation Committee, unsatisfactory in terms of both the health and the safety of workers.
  11.837763250595094
It makes flexibility more widespread, particularly for sea fishermen, establishing the systematic annualisation of reference periods.
  15.782350513716487
It will permit further exemptions to the already excessive legislation of 48 hours per week.
  16.681607113517817
Finally, it will take nine years, in the best possible case, for the working week of doctors in training to be reduced from 58 hours to 48.
  14.111917520669573
In fact, the proposed working time organisation institutes social deregulation at the very time when, in France, doctors in training are campaigning for decent working conditions and genuine safety for service-users.
  16.19505672582577
Proper organisation of working time would entail, we reiterate, a real reduction in working hours accompanied by moves to create a sufficient number of jobs.
  16.019767216376724
We cannot support this report as it stands.
  14.970368545786497
Mr President, this proposal will bring an additional seven million workers in Europe under the protection of the Working Time Directive, allowing them to have reasonable working conditions and proper rest periods.
  17.29746760196228
However, to get a 48-hour week, junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years.
  13.587509752998502
I will not pretend to be happy with this situation.
  25.79034861841099
It is, however, the best that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the Council's delaying tactics.
  17.05092133197197
It has been obvious since 1993 that those excluded from the directive at that time would eventually come under its protection.
  13.209428631802666
One has to ask, therefore, why over that seven-year period virtually nothing was done in Ireland or in Britain to bring the number of doctors forward that would be needed to implement it.
  21.004935672676606
In Ireland some junior doctors work over 100 hours per week, the average being 70 to 80.
  15.786965491209534
Only last night they suspended strike action which they had threatened because they have now reached an interim agreement which will ensure that they are actually paid for the overtime they work.
  13.800219873844203
In some cases they were not paid at all, in some cases only half the normal rate.
  12.300287774000724
Some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard.
  14.495810133957272
Through the Council of Ministers both Britain and Ireland fought tooth-and-nail to slow the process down.
  16.201165757084954
That was unfortunate.
  8.797767558708308
The working arrangements for junior doctors are like a horror story from a Dickensian novel of the nineteenth century.
  13.324403730242752
I find it bizarre that at the beginning of the 21st century we are still arguing for common sense with regard to health and safety.
  14.347694382532614
I would appeal to all national governments, including Ireland, not to utilise the additional provisions for extending the implementation of this directive beyond the nine-year period and would remind them that it is intended only as an exceptional measure if all other genuine steps have been taken to implement the measures here.
  16.49164408385277
Mr President, the proposed working time directive for specific categories of worker such as doctors in training, offshore workers or mobile workers, is typical of the slow and derisory nature of social Europe.
  19.38443056285177
The recitals of the proposal, nonetheless, stress the specific importance of this file, the first major file on social issues, adding, even, that it is a matter of the health and safety of 7 million workers.
  17.391553965650676
In France, for example, a number of strikes by junior doctors recently drew the attention of public opinion to the intolerable length of the working day for this category of worker, harmful to the doctors in training themselves, but also to the quality of the care they are providing their patients with.
  15.938942559241273
The same question arises, with at least as much urgency, for other categories such as offshore workers or transport workers.
  12.89445176580804
What we should have had was a quick decision and an appropriate reduction in working hours.
  10.122394118179109
Well, the proposal does intend to cut hours, but by phasing in the cuts.
  11.820720800976341
For the first three years, 58-hour working weeks are permitted.
  14.391881865293248
We have to wait 5 years for the maximum working week to be reduced to 48 hours, and the Commission is cynical enough to cite technical reasons in order to grant a further 2-year delay in application.
  18.88363846618234
Who are they trying to kid that these measures could not come into force almost immediately if there was any political will to act in favour of the interests of the workers concerned rather than favouring the claims of management?
  18.17508511623165
Some restriction, even a derisory cut, in working hours is better than no restriction at all.
  15.464443353587443
We shall not vote against this text, but we shall conclude from this experience that workers can have no expectations of social Europe and that, decidedly, nothing can replace the collective strength of the workers when it comes to amending legislation in favour of the workers.
  17.257548140064305
Mr President, the chairman of the European Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs could not remain silent in this debate.
  22.414919594057913
Thank heavens, my fellow Members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself.
  11.964342764781529
I shall come back to this point.
  9.100255540077507
We are not terribly proud of the final result, but I should at least like to pay tribute to it, as some outcome had to be found.
  19.711862832985553
At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Smet, our efficient and indefatigable rapporteur, and Mr Provan, who was also the persistent and efficient chairman of our Conciliation Committees.
  16.409794117265964
I should like to thank all our coordinators, Mr Brok, Mr Hughes, Mrs Flautre, Mr Schmid, Mrs Lynne, who demonstrated great understanding in order to reach some sort of outcome.
  24.704609233478358
I should like to pay tribute to the Commission. Without wishing to embarrass you, Mrs Diamantopoulou, throughout almost all this debate Parliament has had the technical and even political support of the Commission, particularly on the important amendments.
  14.028181198890719
I have one small correction to make, unless I misunderstood, to what Mrs Smet has just said. It is not exactly the first successful conciliation on social matters between the European Parliament and the Council.
  19.596877751689046
It is the second, following the successful conciliation on the minor issue of workers working in an explosive atmosphere.
  21.404047507634676
This is, however, an infinitely more wide-ranging issue, of course.
  11.663335486991045
Mr President, I must point out how unusually tough the Council is to deal with.
  14.48077706789897
The political truth is that the Parliament team, in an astounding spirit of responsibility and unanimity - and you have witnessed the benign respect which I and Mr Bushill-Matthews, for example, have for each other - was remarkable for its united front as much as for its determination to succeed.
  18.9630941542737
Parliament made most of the running.
  7.870418139864369
We are not proud of the result in terms of the content.
  22.748921156922265
In a real democracy Parliament would have been determining the legislation.
  12.718726760601038
I would like to remind the Council that we are just as dedicated to achieving results, but that they must not expect Parliament to make quite so many concessions on a regular basis.
  18.181567062623383
Mr President, I would like first of all to make three political comments.
  16.648858398503833
I feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will, there is a way.
  12.406723099356388
In order for this conciliation to succeed, we had to take account of the fifteen different systems in the Member States, different fields of work and proposals from various employer and employee federations.
  17.98327201624085
We also had to take account of the viability of health services as things now stand and competitiveness in sectors such as transport and fisheries.
  13.687197602993919
This was no mean feat!
  7.350890574371924
It has taken six years to achieve today' s result and it is the first major conciliation decision in the social sphere - and I say major because it affects some 5 million workers.
  17.96436982822809
I feel that the most interesting point - and this is my third comment - is the number of workers affected by this directive, who are at present excluded from the working time directive and who will enjoy these rights once this directive is applied.
  18.966894072756528
In my view, therefore, we should be satisfied regardless of whether or not this directive meets all our requirements.
  19.49763868716069
The upshot is that the provisions of the working directive will apply to doctors in training, workers at sea, rail workers and all non-mobile workers in excluded sectors.
  20.18848168757545
I would like in particular to thank the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Rocard, the Vice-Chairman, Mr Provan, who used his great experience to guide the conciliation procedure, and of course, Mrs Smet who, with her wealth of ministerial experience, helped achieve such a difficult conciliation.
  14.018357473361288
I would also like to give special thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and the Member States, particularly those which, for reasons we cannot go into right now, have experienced major problems with their national health services, such as Great Britain, Spain and Ireland.
  16.881224933038375
Certain speakers raised the issue of the implementation of the directive.
  12.718163919928807
I should like to stress that it is indeed a particularly important issue.
  16.35470749193746
One of the Commission' s fundamental duties is to monitor the implementation of directives.
  17.2186471904479
Here I should like to ask the MEPs to cooperate with us and closely monitor any underhanded plans in Member States, so that the Commission can intervene immediately.
  11.057004742048093
A further two questions have also been raised, the first by Messrs Hughes, Schmid and Pronk as to what we intend to do in the road and rail transport sectors.
  14.113796177791851
First, I must tell you that the Transport Council is involved, making the whole process even more complicated.
  15.225841117235175
Secondly, as for road transport, the Commission tabled a proposal in 1996, but it was blocked by the Council in 1998.
  26.6807461194271
The Commission intends, with the cooperation of the French Presidency, to re-table the issue.
  19.081186211546765
We are awaiting new negotiations by the social partners and we hope to obtain their assent.
  14.464496657717175
If we cannot proceed in this way, we shall have to change the whole approach we have adopted so far.
  10.704901832441127
With regard to the issue of fisheries, the matter was raised once again by Mr Hudghton.
  22.089654568310593
We have discussed this in the past.
  20.148085836964086
I will try to clarify it.
  8.931903909446062
I am afraid I was not clear enough.
  28.372449108256568
So I would like to repeat that the issue of self-employment in fisheries is not included in this directive.
  16.903391187005404
The self-employed in fisheries is a matter of national competence.
  17.062225237917787
That is very clear and very precise.
  11.678309231836273
I thank you very much for all your support and help during these discussions, and that of your services.
  12.224810854479282
It is very much appreciated indeed.
  8.291883254841123
The debate is closed.
  6.897709024325673
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
  16.985115877308363
Reviewing aid to third countries
  8.854489021826852
The next item is the Commission communication - Reviewing aid to third countries.
  11.623935435620309
Mr President, I hope Parliament will excuse me if shortly after making a brief presentation I have to leave, but this is, as Parliament knows, very much the collective work of the RELEX Commissioners as a whole and very much the shared work of my colleague, Commissioner Nielson and myself.
  21.84783754487175
Commissioner Nielson will still be here to make his own contribution to this report and to answer any questions which may arise.
  15.356202530868423
The function I have to attend is a joint meeting of two committees which was specially arranged to discuss a number of external assistance issues so I hope Parliament will be understanding.
  20.86032264430465
I think it is fair to say that the proposals that we have put forward go right to the heart of the issues that are raised in the White Paper on reform and it is extremely important for us to demonstrate that the reform of our external assistance programmes is the flagship or one of the flagships, for an overall reform process.
  16.10766958265279
People occasionally get a little bored when one talks about internal procedures but what they should recognise is what we are discussing in these particular proposals: ways in which, first of all, we can get assistance to people more rapidly and effectively and, secondly, ways in which we can change the image of the European Union around the world.
  15.748005805941977
All of us have, alas, experienced too frequently occasions when instead of us getting the credit for what we are trying to do on behalf of Europe's taxpayers, we get blamed for not doing it a lot more effectively and a lot more rapidly.
  19.900088924945322
I hope that is a problem which we will be able to tackle.
  15.068734204407235
Very briefly, it is worth reminding ourselves what the background to this issue is.
  11.266722570069629
We have seen a threefold increase in external assistance commitments managed by the SCR over the last 10 years.
  21.32674786059132
That has been driven by events and by political pressures; a recognition of the responsibilities we should discharge in Central and Eastern Europe - the recognition which that triggered of our responsibilities in the Mediterranean.
  16.82255382343117
It is worth noting that our assistance programmes in the Mediterranean have increased four and a half times since 1990.
  29.43360609210094
Then there is the Balkans crisis where the attempts to put in place a common foreign and security policy are being particularly tested.
  14.271714977164802
While our external assistance programmes themselves have grown very rapidly, staff resources have failed to keep pace.
  15.979231548491294
The Commission has 2.9 staff for every EUR 10 million that we manage.
  14.020142442463902
That compares with an average figure about twice that for Member States - the figure is 5.7 but it goes as high as 9 for some Member States and 4.2 for the World Bank.
  14.697264265287558
One of the consequences of that has been the increasing use of technical assistance offices which has been much criticised by Parliament and by the Court of Auditors on the grounds of weak monitoring and a lack of political control.
  16.518635322441295
It is worth noting that we have spent about EUR 170 million a year on the 80 technical assistance offices which is equivalent to the cost of 800 staff working for the Commission.
  21.531052757809864
A consequence of all this is that the SCR today has over EUR 21 billion in outstanding commitments awaiting payments.
  13.009171155922957
That is an embarrassingly large figure.
  9.118392226155187
I do not blame the staff of the SCR who work extremely hard in very difficult circumstances, but there are not enough of them.
  16.193814417847758
They have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures.
  8.272484798635245
They have also had to operate against a background of Member States second, third and fourth guessing every implementation decision that we try to make.
  26.96312265439754
We have brought forward in the document, which has now been made public, our proposals for dealing with this problem.
  16.266716591233013
As honourable Members will know, over the years Parliament has put forward a number of proposals including the idea that we should externalise the management of our overseas aid.
  20.719056399336672
That remains a possibility for the long term though it would take some time because one would first have to get in place the necessary legal framework.
  17.612509450157127
However my principal concern at the moment is not how we get from A to Z - that often seems rather easier than getting from A to B. What we have to do - whatever the long term objective may be is - to find better ways of managing our external assistance straightaway.
  17.752345756101896
We have put forward a number of proposals. We have put forward proposals for improving programming: making sure that all the RELEX Commissioners share responsibility for programming - we have suggested the reuniting of the project cycle from identification to implementation - we think the present split has not worked well.
  16.770933706139687
What we propose to do is to create a new implementation body replacing the SCR which we think should be called Europe Aid.
  11.372675008261092
It would be initially an office under a board made up of all the External Relations Commissioners though, as I say, the option of moving to externalisation in the longer term remains on the table.
  16.57888768757945
We want to devolve more responsibility to delegations and, where possible, to national authorities in the field.
  8.726358430581117
We have proposed special treatment for the pre-accession strategy: humanitarian assistance and macro-financial assistance with fully integrated management.
  19.82818617999212
That means, for example, transferring the residual SCR functions for PHARE to the Directorate-General for Enlargement.
  8.983605288457976
We have proposed taking urgent measures to tackle the backlog of old and dormant projects.
  13.733088017050392
We are writing to the relevant chairmen of parliamentary committees and to the Court of Auditors to explain our approach.
  12.667548623005958
I do not want to go on for very much longer, except to say this: where will the resources come from to manage and run our programmes in the proposed office, Europe Aid, rather better in the future than we have managed in the past?
  16.945737616029113
We have to take our turn with others in the Commission in arguing our corner in the peer group process for the assistance we think is required to manage our programmes effectively.
  18.211164902631975
We may, as a result, present the budgetary authority with a rectifying letter to the 2001 budget proposals in September.
  17.012624080062782
That is for the future.
  8.949394175592252
The simple point I want to make is this: we cannot go on as we have.
  22.960913476894195
In my judgement it is simply not an option.
  8.455399847237956
We have to do better.
  17.354918775995127
We are not bidding for a bigger empire.
  10.809739130120315
The budgetary authority will ultimately have to judge the right scale of European Union external aid programmes.
  14.67147329114658
However, my only aim is to put the Commission in a position where it can run these programmes competently.
  14.62797101538029
I have to say very bluntly to Parliament that there are two possibilities: either the budgetary authority agrees with our ideas and will then try to implement them from 2001, or else, in order to manage what our programmes amount to more competently, we will be obliged to propose very large cuts.
  25.964156861812512
We cannot go on in a situation in which we are not prepared to provide the resources to manage effectively the money that is voted by the budgetary authority for our external assistance programmes.
  15.587609792173428
We have to be prepared to face up to the management and administrative consequences of what we are trying to do around the world, otherwise the people who suffer are those who should be receiving our help to enable them to read and write or live a better and healthier life or create the institutions of good governance in their communities.
  17.46850790286846
They are the people who suffer as well as the European Union's reputation.
  14.173299927683642
I am sure this will be a long debate.
  15.874465229576147
I am sure that Parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months.
  19.357569911603676
However, my impression after a few months in this job is that Parliament wants as badly as the Commission to deliver a more competently run assistance programme all around the world.
  18.762902216887728
Mr President, this is refreshing - the fact that the European Union is acknowledging that there are problems but that we have solutions.
  18.549703792845584
Commissioner Nielson will recall that a couple of months ago I suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes.
  18.805155203611285
Is it not the case now that this proposal, taking away so much from DG Development as it does, is likely to make my prediction come true?
  21.013126832136585
Secondly, at the end of what Commissioner Patten was saying, I think he reiterated what he was quoted as saying in "The Times" this morning where he said that Member States should back his plans with resources or cut aid.
  15.589224705425641
I have to say, Commissioners, that I find this a deeply worrying and dangerous statement and likely to be taken at its face value by Member States and not in the way that you suggest.
  25.451457119618077
I would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other Commissioner.
  15.60752308697149
Mr President, I do not feel like an emperor without clothes, but you can judge for yourself.
  9.74703633147653
The situation is that we had to do something not just to integrate the project cycle in terms of the line management of activities.
  14.147403516046971
We also had to do something concerning squaring the circle organisationally giving substance to my political overall responsibility for development policy.
  14.6810719241835
We have done this without changing the portfolios that were defined.
  10.185752147128328
The solution we have reached is to create a board of directors which will oversee and politically be the managerial part of running the new office or EuropeAid or whatever SCR is going to be called.
  15.494547085062434
My role on that board will be that of the chief executive officer.
  9.791234403446401
Commissioner Patten will be chairman, reflecting the position he already has at the head of the table being the ultimate coordinator of all RELEX Commissioners' activities.
  14.811700289431831
We are in a sense structuring the political roles that have been defined and we are doing it in such a way that I think it really does have a chance of functioning.
  16.12921346222439
There are two elements in this which will contribute to better coherence and better political consistency.
  11.239108753538481
One is what I have already mentioned with a closer political involvement in the management of the actual implementation.
  13.253006005044666
The other one is the quality-support group which will have its secretariat in DG Development.
  15.74463986435061
The role is to make sure that the formulation of the different programmes, including those in DG RELEX, is consistent with the policy and principles that we have defined.
  16.513806778550705
All in all, I think this is a good attempt at doing things given the way things were defined last July.
  19.08686134811586
This will also concentrate a lot of attention among all RELEX Commissioners on the problem of whether or not we actually are delivering.
  15.292252697786312
We have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of delivering.
  17.981966376802298
What we are doing here will be part of that change.
  9.768497212383659
We also talk about ownership in our partner countries as being a major problem.
  19.006614291223283
The reality, because of the way we are organised in the Commission, is that ownership on our side is extremely vague and problematic.
  16.68522930946519
This is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now.
  15.70222496039245
Finally, I will address the issue of the risk of what happens if we do not get the staff and the resources to do the job.
  20.42045411931482
Clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable, it is not possible.
  12.76556611081396
We have to make the point as clearly as Commissioner Patten just did which means that we want those resources.
  11.167235599666377
We have commitments, we have an agreement with 71 ACP states, we have the Member States backing that and accepting the next ninth European Development Fund.
  22.306540959758454
All this is part of the promises we have made already, so there is really no alternative to getting the people to do the job.
  15.709286745063432
But how to do it - this is a problem we cannot solve alone, which is why we are appealing as strongly and clearly as we are; and we make no secret of the fact that if the budget authority will not make it possible to get the staff, we will not be able to do the job.
  22.188169097620527
This is the situation as we see it.
  13.921389077889453
We do not want to invest our own role as Commissioners in fighting a losing battle.
  14.831290280472272
We want to fight a battle we can be proud of participating in.
  10.999094029948967
Mr President, I am very happy to hear that, in order to fulfil commitments, more resources and personnel are required.
  11.726720704519412
As Parliament is aware of this, we will offer our full support.
  18.79527174317187
However, I would like to ask a question, since I have not had time to study the document at length.
  13.91275632609154
What will happen to humanitarian aid?
  7.154062029464587
We understand that the Union' s policy of humanitarian aid does not end with simply granting it, but it has to continue - we talk in this context of a 'continuum' - so that development policies can be carried out.
  18.73331329732419
Otherwise, we may see a repetition of what is happening in Mozambique at the moment: clearly, humanitarian aid was removed, ECHO disappeared, development policy is no longer being implemented and therefore, violence may erupt once again.
  19.31428100178512
Within this 'continuum' I would like to know whether, as has been the case until now, ECHO will be an office dependent on the Commission, but whose action will be based on development policies aimed at what we want to see, and that is the eradication of poverty.
  17.28947036036417
Mr President, it is a shame that Mr Patten had to leave so soon.
  22.199393983295476
I actually wanted to put my question to him.
  10.77480876010084
But I think that Mr Nielson is equally well placed to answer me because he has been standing by his colleague' s side and he also said that both Commissioners were responsible for the proposal.
  19.863082528487443
Mr Nielson, of course we here in Parliament share your aim of providing quicker aid to men and women, and raising the profile of the European Union.
  26.65287614197822
That goes without saying.
  7.483400241302604
But we had all agreed that what the Commission wanted to introduce now by way of reform had to be done jointly with us.
  13.987475981817171
When Mr Patten says in his presentation that either the Commission programme is accepted or we must make cuts, I find that highly displeasing.
  12.747618811381804
It is we who are the budgetary authority, or at least part of it, and I think that the Commission cannot simply say we shall make cuts or we shall have to make cuts.
  17.766130951868483
That, if you please, has to go through the budgetary procedure first and what is certain is that you will have to implement your reform programme jointly with us.
  16.43820269031582
I should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat.
  8.42296448897597
Mr President, I am very sorry that Commissioner Patten had to leave.
  12.675240059203139
In his absence I am delighted to direct my questions to the Development Commissioner, Mr Nielson.
  11.629325378875567
I am delighted to hear of new innovations and reorganisations which the Commission is going to put into place.
  13.073295239032523
EuropeAid would be a very important attribute of the European Union as far as our external relations are concerned.
  15.248830592987407
It has been extremely embarrassing so far that some of our promises have not been kept.
  18.186304251268066
Not keeping promises to the poorest people in the world is not the nicest way to go about - as a rich part of the world - trying to help them.
  13.731104246769151
Consolidating the RELEX Commissioners and increasing the management support staff and resources have my fullest support.
  15.373576127473301
I am also delighted to hear that they are planning to create a board very much like the World Bank.
  17.877466461747062
But I should like to ask Commissioner Nielson if he has thought about something which is very important to this side of the House - the IFC in the World Bank has the ability to help in the private sector with funding.
  13.089122662272159
Micro-credits and various other mechanisms are key to helping people to help themselves.
  11.788726469317732
Have they considered extending, in EuropeAid, some element of helping people to help themselves through an investment arm where the European Union becomes a partner in venture and enterprise?
  14.354010874431694
Firstly, ECHO is not affected by this reform of development assistance.
  13.234215119676298
ECHO is going to continue.
  5.709823057922817
This is clearly part of what we have decided.
  12.445799783100224
The only issue is to create a better link or bridge between the phase of humanitarian assistance and the more forward-oriented, long-term development assistance.
  9.875525655672412
This is a well established discussion.
  12.842296680465862
We want to keep ECHO more or less the way it is.
  12.890492279163302
I have confidence that with the new director of ECHO we are on track.
  12.327616281535924
To Mrs Haug I should like to make it clear that Commissioner Patten was saying that we will have to propose deep cuts in the level of activity if we do not get a positive response from the budget authorities concerning the staff issue.
  18.375645455264085
Why are we saying this as clearly as we are, even running the risk of being interpreted as if issuing a threat?
  18.464687224921736
I noticed your choice of word there.
  15.861108037502152
We think it is necessary to make it clear that we seriously think it is problematic to continue without the resources and the manpower that we need.
  15.156165923180982
It is not possible to do this well without being more or less organised like other well-performing donors.
  11.141586913257298
This is the message.
  5.307867316592759
It may very well be the case that we are being misunderstood in this Parliament because, on this matter, we are definitely among friends.
  12.376473879792584
So saying it as clearly as we do here may sound wrong.
  14.035323837535538
I realise that.
  4.031442273052346
But there are other elements around.
  7.244973776442795
We have to say it à tous azimuts.
  9.539352317535903
It is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear.
  9.295973622440476
I do not mean to be negative about ministers of finance, but sometimes they can be quite demanding partners in discussion.
  16.208161724842753
Development ministers are not that unproblematic either.
  11.18072910578106
The biggest problem is actually the lack of consistency between the level of ambition defined in this field and the resources and tools that we have available to carry out the job.
  20.23371726836179
This is our biggest problem.
  13.002069207475113
We will be making a positive effort to get a solution that makes it possible to continue at least at the level of activity that we have now.
  17.26448733868133
I should like to add that, though it is right to point out the backlog, the problems and the embarrassment, it should not be forgotten that we are building roads out there, thousands of kilometres in length; we are drilling bore-holes for clean, safe water, giving millions of people access to safe drinking water every year.
  19.176054898574353
We are investing in people in primary education in a large number of countries.
  35.977028005688375
We are making a contribution to the debt initiative second to none, even comparing ourselves with the biggest countries in the world.
  17.030290446280883
We would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned.
  15.10589184903484
I warn against giving the impression our development cooperation activities have all but stopped.
  18.892771027872385
That is not the case.
  9.106065039194688
We have to be realistic, clear and demanding in order to enter the primary league amongst donors and not to remain where we are right now.
  19.64017371126281
This is the goal.
  5.9012588755018545
Mr Deva, we will, as part of the new Suva Agreement - the successor to the Lomé Convention - be including in our activities a EUR 2.2 billion private investment facility which will be administered by the European Investment Bank at arm's length.
  18.59776717300659
It will deal with private partners, inspiring and helping the creation of business activities between European companies and business in the developing ACP countries.
  14.87013856564491
This major innovation is being prepared right now on the same basis as you were talking about.
  19.169644824528522
Micro-credit is a big thing but it is not the only answer to all problems.
  11.343270902129618
However, we are quite active in this field also.
  9.489590922817039
I thank Parliament for what I sense to be a more than positive reception because the critical notes that I have heard are of a kind that I would tend to interpret as enthusiastic support.
  16.99442463044108
We should be careful not to end up facing a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our sights lower.
  13.081996866779265
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson, for your optimistic view of the future.
  13.968748401277502
Question Time (Commission)
  14.630087664290624
The next item is Question Time (B5-0220/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.
  18.65290674104944
First part
  3.201174878917123
Question No 32 by (H-0433/00):
  17.63353805848993
Subject: Jailing of opposition politician Xu Wenli in China Is the Commission aware of the recent trial involving Xu Wenli in China and the severe prison sentence that was imposed.
  20.149808283255137
What action did the Commission take?
  13.476387130724284
The Commission is aware of the recent trial referred to by the honourable Member in his question and of the sentence imposed on Mr Liu, who assisted Xu Wenli in setting up a branch of the banned China Democracy Party.
  13.99915262555722
Xu Wenli, one of the founders of the CDP, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in December 1998, along with two other prominent democracy campaigners.
  18.925051241040947
As the honourable Member will know, the longstanding policy of the Union is to raise the individual cases of Chinese citizens who have been in prison for political offences with the Chinese authorities, particularly in the context of the human rights dialogue, the last meeting of which took place on 25 February this year.
  17.4690632073152
The Union has therefore raised with the Chinese Government the cases of Xu Wenli and others who have been trying to exercise basic rights that are specified by the United Nation's Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was actually signed by China in October 1998.
  21.267283739602583
To date, the Commission knows that at least 23 CDP members have been jailed for subversion as a result of their efforts to exercise those rights to which China is committed.
  17.574403936417458
In relation to these and other cases, the Commission consistently calls upon the People's Republic of China to comply with the letter and spirit of the United Nation's human rights conventions which it has signed; to do so even before China's ratification of those conventions and actively to pursue ratification.
  25.22663054550617
These efforts by the Commission will continue.
  6.6877592860536055
I thank you, Commissioner, for your answer and I should like to ask whether the Commission is aware that 14 months into his 13-year prison sentence Mr Xu is suffering from hepatitis and there are serious doubts as to the effectiveness of the medical treatment he is receiving.
  21.3544779904989
I would seek an assurance that the Commission will enquire into this and ask the Chinese authorities whether they are providing the appropriate medical treatment.
  16.86239906509867
Bearing in mind, Commissioner, what you said about your willingness to raise individual cases, could I also ask you to make enquiries about the fate of Rebiya Kadeer.
  18.724386787996206
She was arrested on 11 August 1999 in Urumqui, the capital of the XUAR, while on her way to meet representatives of the US Congressional Research Service.
  14.769469841304169
She was charged with providing secret information to foreigners and is believed to have been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment at a secret trial.
  16.831415425441676
I will gladly provide more detailed information on that, Mr Commissioner.
  13.930269731467842
It makes me even more angry that European Union Member States, faced with these cases and the 23 in general you referred to, show such spinelessness in refusing to support the US initiative in Geneva at the UN Commission on Human Rights attacking China's human rights record.
  21.292321464906717
I should like to tell the honourable Member that in respect to Mr Xu, I will convey what he said about the apparently grave condition of that political prisoner to my colleagues in the external relations area.
  18.265891349154064
I am certain that they will follow previous practice in making enquiries of the Chinese authorities as to the quality and consistency of the treatment of Mr Xu for hepatitis.
  17.40950394985336
I know that my colleagues will be happy to respond to the honourable Member in order to keep him informed with any information they are able to obtain.
  13.892695522366544
So far as Miss Kadeer is concerned, obviously I did not have notice of that question and am not in a position to respond.
  23.16700961626767
The question will, however, have been recorded.
  20.310117900626892
I will bring it to the attention of my colleagues and they will provide the honourable Member with the response he is seeking.
  15.167737011024261
Obviously, it would be a matter of great concern if someone, whose only offence is to be antagonistic towards an existing regime, were to be the victim of insufferable treatment.
  20.799742802025044
I know that my colleagues elsewhere in the Commission share this view, which I share with the honourable Member.
  16.21836632786293
Question No 34 by (H-0357/00):
  11.274619411739264
Subject: The Commission's reform programme and enlargement On 1 March 2000, the Commission adopted the White Paper on the reform of the Commission.
  15.538495520485222
The measures and actions announced in the White Paper provide for a radical reform of the Commission which will involve a considerable amount of time.
  10.346995463652458
Can the Commission indicate to what extent the present reform proposals take account of the forthcoming enlargement?
  12.469008535232602
Do they anticipate the consequences which enlargement will have on the internal structure of the Commission and do the proposed measures and actions take account of such consequences?
  15.917218417900937
If so, in what way? If not, would it not have been more logical for the Commission to take account of enlargement in respect of certain aspects, thereby avoiding a situation whereby shortly after completion of the current reform process the Commission has to enter into a fresh round of reforms to cope with the impact of enlargement?
  16.515535189966762
Does the Commission intend to present an action plan with a timetable, as is the case with the present reform plan, in order to prepare the structure of the Commission for the forthcoming enlargement?
  12.443941072946162
The Commission's reform strategy White Paper fulfils the undertakings readily given to Parliament and to the Council last year to give immediate attention to addressing the way in which the Institution, as an organisation, currently undertakes its duties.
  21.628079172419888
Delay in designing a practical strategy and in pursuing necessary modernisation would not have been acceptable to the Commission, to the Council, to this Parliament or to the public, as I am sure the honourable Member understands.
  15.807957126205165
One of the specifically stated purposes of comprehensive reform is the development of strengthened administrative performance which will, amongst other things, enable the Commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future Union and in the wider world.
  20.519690948791723
Clearly the challenges posed by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those presented by any previous enlargement.
  24.889651503759964
The Commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development.
  17.18502382069094
As the College of Commissioners made clear in our introduction to the White Paper, and elsewhere in that document, and I quote what we said: "the challenges of globalisation and future enlargement require better governance at all levels including the European Union".
  21.084363135031104
All political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the Commission.
  10.903510716889437
Reform is therefore an essential precondition - a precondition for realising our vision of Europe.
  11.035673330988569
The current administrative reform is not a limited exercise - it is an evolutionary process as we have made very clear - it will be continuously monitored and the results achieved will be assessed in order to provide for any relevant adjustments.
  18.863239302926
Proper account will be taken of any specific requirements that arise from the enlargement process, and naturally that will apply to human resources implications of the ongoing change.
  15.436285392725358
Issues such as the management of the increased cultural diversity within the Commission and an early retirement scheme that is directly linked to enlargement will, for instance, be amongst those that receive particular attention.
  14.64183616168975
As with past enlargements, specific measures concerning the appointment and integration of officials from the new Member States will be adopted at the appropriate time.
  17.238607631664735
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response.
  9.519418423556822
I would, however, like to add something.
  16.044741760485408
One of the main challenges in the enlargement process will be to tailor the veterinary and plant-health conditions prevalent in the acceding countries to those in the European Union.
  8.611346694931585
Would the Commissioner be prepared to encourage observers from the Central and Eastern European countries that wish to join the EU, to attend management committees, scientific committees or any other committees concerned with veterinary and plant health, on a permanent basis?
  19.20311089369725
Mr President, the honourable Member's approach to these and many other matters is I know extremely constructive.
  14.255345769970269
What I know on the basis of precedent, and also the Commission's assessment of the scope and the depth of the challenges that arise from the forthcoming enlargement, is that appropriate measures will be taken at the right time not only in terms of the recruitment and integration of properly skilled staff from the new Member States but also to assist with the preparation of other areas of expertise - presumably including the Scientific and other committees.
  15.572572618789222
To some extent, of course, the process will be assisted by the fact that the international science community inside and outside the European Union is genuinely international.
  19.871220211886076
In addition to relying upon those casual professional relationships, I am sure that the Commission will want to ensure that there is continuity and access provided for those new incoming Member States not only in areas like those that he has mentioned - veterinary and plant health - but in many other areas where the smoothest possible integration of efforts is a matter of crucial and mutual importance.
  19.951769072654386
Question No 35 by (H-0411/00):
  4.5656732759302985
Subject: Boarding of Community vessels by Canadian inspectors in international waters Five years after the seizure of the Estai, the Community fleet fishing in NAFO international waters has expressed deep concern at the boarding of a Portuguese vessel, the Santa Mafalda, supposedly by Canadian inspectors.
  15.593174834594016
The Santa Mafalda, a vessel used to catch halibut, was boarded on 24 April last. The inspectors confiscated all documentation and refused to leave the vessel.
  15.07610365800381
Furthermore, a launch belonging to the Canadian authorities has been tracking the vessel constantly, thus hampering its fishing activity.
  14.102016475934608
A few days earlier, Canadian inspectors had apparently boarded a Spanish freezer trawler, which was also fishing in international waters.
  20.62372002512863
European fishermen fear that the underlying aim of these boarding incidents is to deter them from using the fishing grounds in which they catch halibut and cod.
  20.163489792779753
What information does the Commission possess on these incidents?
  9.804879474283734
Can it clarify whether the inspectors were acting on behalf of NAFO or the Canadian Government?
  13.546500043397028
Has it taken any action in this regard, or does it intend to do so?
  13.724006121196911
Should accepting Community monitoring rules for inspections in NAFO waters prove problematic for Canada, what initiatives could the Commission take to set clear and binding rules which would allay the doubts of those working in the sector and the Canadian Government alike?
  18.481254280765917
Thank you Mr President.
  6.941387609036833
As the honourable Member who raised the question will know, in accordance with the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance, each contracting party may assign means of inspection and inspectors to the NAFO scheme and NAFO inspectors may inspect any fishing vessel flying the flag of a contracting party.
  17.248944958659763
NAFO inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the NAFO scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them.
  15.134019238833424
Against that background, on 23 April two Canadian NAFO inspectors accompanied by a trainee carried out an inspection of the Community fishing vessel Santa Mafalda which was operating at that time in the NAFO regulatory area.
  12.163220211059166
The Canadian inspectors in question and the surveillance vessel from which the inspection was carried out are assigned to the NAFO scheme.
  15.470654611420917
Their inspection was carried out under its auspices.
  3.586969895847485
Having been informed by the Canadians, inspectors of the Commission boarded the Santa Mafalda to verify the grounds on which the Canadian inspectors based their citation of a serious infringement.
  16.921289458319503
In conducting this verification the Commission inspectors ensured the security and continuity of the evidence on board and transmitted their report to the Portuguese authorities.
  12.942155187377619
Those authorities in turn ordered the Santa Mafalda to the port of Aveiro in Portugal for a thorough inspection.
  19.814906389744948
The Santa Mafalda arrived in Aveiro on 10 May 2000 and two Commission inspectors participated in a thorough inspection of the vessel.
  15.166371067438103
The Commission has drawn the attention of the Canadian authorities to the procedures followed by the Canadian inspectors in relation to their seizure of documentation and their continued stay on board the Santa Mafalda.
  20.37598363780585
The Commission takes the view that the Canadian NAFO inspectors in question acted in breach of the NAFO scheme by taking away documents from the vessel without the permission of the master and by continuing to stay on board the vessel.
  15.684653612821693
However, it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the Portuguese authorities did not oppose the prolonged stay of the Canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the Santa Mafalda were not obstructed.
  16.037397803325074
Mr Commissioner, I am satisfied with your reply, but I would like to add something else.
  13.751196357349823
The sea is a difficult world, and the Community fleet which fishes in international Atlantic waters experiences the interference of controllers and patrols from coastal countries which give the impression that, behind the harassment they sometimes suffer, there is one sole intention; to expel them from those fishing grounds.
  21.108556801245715
The Commissioner knows, as I do, that the current situation in the NAFO is not, fortunately, what it was five years ago after the seizure of the Estai.
  18.809536823099624
The European Commission - like the fishing sector itself - has made significant efforts to iron out our differences.
  17.6845617144742
However, there are still outstanding questions, such as the extraterritorial clauses, which allow the Canadian Government to carry out inspections, controls and seizures beyond their national waters, in open sea, which is incompatible with international provisions and which, all too frequently, involves the arbitrary application of controls within the framework of the NAFO.
  16.342171982742524
For all these reasons, I would like to ask the Commissioner how the European Commission intends to defend the right of the Community fleet to fish freely in these waters, albeit within the existing rules.
  13.560548861315906
Mr President, I am grateful to the honourable lady.
  15.5421504072679
The only way in which we can actually ensure the proper maintenance of an international convention which has the effect of law is to demand on all occasions that the procedures required under the law are fulfilled properly in a balanced but a completely full way.
  18.694061789581927
That is the position being taken by the Commission which is why I drew attention to the fact that the Commissioners have already reached the conclusion that the Canadian inspectors actually acted in breach of the scheme by taking documents without the sight of the master and by virtue, maybe, of their very prolonged stay on board that vessel.
  16.18782157550941
The Portuguese authorities, as the honourable lady will know because of her interest, are now undertaking a full investigation and it would therefore not be proper for the Commission to communicate opinions beyond those I have already offered, but she can be absolutely certain that the Commission and its inspectors together with the Member States are vigilant in sustaining the proper rights of all vessels on the high seas.
  20.35534909679658
Mr President, I had asked the question as a result of Mr Kinnock' s first reply, before Mrs Miguélez asked her question.
  13.121505042846596
I had understood from Mr Kinnock that the ship was in fact being inspected in a Portuguese port and that this inspection had taken place in the presence of Community inspectors.
  14.923434969488795
I understand, from his second reply, that he does not yet have the result of that inspection.
  10.828269371456418
That is what I wanted him to clarify.
  15.591138361168442
If he does have it, I would like him to say so, but I understand from his second reply that he does not.
  15.432657987026099
If that is the case I believe it would be prudent and logical for us to await the final result.
  12.681372256106037
I would ask Mr Kinnock to communicate to Mr Fischler that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to know the result of that inspection as soon as possible.
  16.821753955658874
I would like to receive it because this Parliament will have to act accordingly.
  7.695317575905053
In any event, I would like to condemn, in support of Mrs Miguélez, the abuse of authority on the part of the Canadian NAFO inspectors which Mr Kinnock mentioned.
  16.733728074147045
I would therefore like to make that request and condemn this violation of NAFO regulations.
  15.866196182213217
Mr President, I will draw the honourable Member's remarks to the attention of my colleague, Mr Fischler, and I know that they will be of interest to him.
  25.323111365558248
He summarises the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the Portuguese authorities are reaching their conclusions.
  24.61453472709856
It would not be proper publicly to pursue the matter further, but when the report of that inspection and the assessment by the Portuguese authorities are available, I am certain that they will be communicated to interested Members including, of course, the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and I am certain the honourable lady whose interest is manifest.
  16.815841384959693
Question No 36 by (H-0415/00):
  10.958344937935182
Subject: Need to support and strengthen the olive oil sector The implementation of the new olive oil regulation is having severe consequences for Greek producers who are poor farmers in infertile and island regions.
  20.32390521312303
The abolition of the intervention price which had already been eroded has brought producer prices down to derisory levels: together with the co-responsibility levy this has had the effect of decimating olive oil producers' incomes.
  16.717867287984724
The profiteering of traders who sell olive oil to the consumer at prices many times the producers' price have increased, and the small quota accorded to Greece in practice cancels out the entitlement to plant a further 3 000 hectares provided for in the new regulation.
  27.33234561294947
Since olive oil is a basic product and the main source of income for farmers from the most disadvantaged regions in Greece and is also a staple of the Mediterranean diet, will the Commission say what measures it intends to take to protect olive oil cultivation and producers' incomes so as to enable them to stay on the land and when it intends to act?
  18.808748997812323
Does it intend to increase the quota in order to cover existing production and the volume of production expected to result from the new plantations?
  15.548238381414848
Will it reintroduce the institution of intervention, but improved as far as prices and the date of commencement are concerned?
  14.827129042054038
Finally, will it draw up and implement an integrated and effective policy to promote and advertise olive oil both in the EU countries and in third countries, so that olive oil can occupy the place to which it is entitled - according to scientific findings - in the human diet?
  16.00893937394276
Second part
  2.224252584289632
Questions to Mr Solbes
  3.6901416794933954
One of the greatest benefits of the question time arrangement is the way in which it endows me with instant expertise on issues as far apart as fishing, olive oil and human rights in China!
  16.51345447011567
I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas.
  7.035345841747364
In June 1998, the Commission undertook to present a proposal on the future of the common organisation of the market in olive oil to the Council and Parliament in 2000.
  17.911450136489407
The new regime would apply from the 2001/2002 marketing year which, as the honourable Member will know, begins on 1 November 2001.
  13.051351921930864
The Commission is currently studying new data on the structure of olive oil production in the various producer Member States, as well as developments in the world market where the Community is the leading producer by a considerable margin.
  21.021238629653126
The study will also take into account the need to draw up an olive oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product.
  16.68402618194033
As far as product promotion is concerned, the Community is already financing promotion campaigns through the International Olive Oil Council.
  16.09169666900263
Those campaigns appear to have a positive effect within the European Union and indeed in third countries.
  15.253247977672446
In response to a specific issue raised by the honourable Member's question, I have to point out that the produce of new plantings would not give entitlement to aid.
  17.853045949264533
However, the Commission hopes that the Community producers concerned will benefit fully under derogations from the rules as they relate to approved planting programmes, although the olive oil in question would count towards the maximum guaranteed quantity which has already been set.
  16.33103069791079
Finally, the Commission wishes to point out that rather than simply abolishing the intervention system, what has actually happened is that it has been replaced by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support.
  14.707122933682003
Since the start of the 1998/99 marketing year, it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid.
  12.50888893699901
However, it is worth emphasising that over that same period the old buying-in intervention system would not have been activated either.
  22.020078276939707
Mr President, we do indeed appear to be having problems understanding each other in this Chamber.
  16.42270648869415
Because of the policies of the European Union, olive oil producers are truly at the mercy of big producers who negotiate among themselves and try to buy olive oil at unbelievably low prices.
  16.108132057105802
This situation has reached dramatic proportions with the abolition of the albeit downgraded intervention system and the system of private storage, let me assure you is, quite frankly, a joke.
  14.631101285012965
So how are we to deal with this situation?
  13.4832520588555
Will an improved intervention system providing rudimentary protection for producers be reintroduced?
  6.985718264676943
And given that, on a global scale, olive oil is so important to the human body and plays such an important role in maintaining farming populations in disadvantaged areas, why is it that the quotas, particularly for Greece, are so low?
  14.883468317461686
Are you going to increase them?
  5.426150776375979
And with the widespread practice of mixing olive oil with sunflower seed oil, what does the Commission intend to do to put a stop to this practice, which is harming producers and consumers to the benefit of industrial racketeers?
  12.103218334580543
In this spirit, does the Commission believe that this phenomenon can be tackled through guile, i.e., by increasing the quota for Italy, which is the main country responsible for mixing oil, and reducing the quota for Greece?
  19.14454716970097
I am grateful to the honourable Member and I know of the deep concerns he voices. They certainly are communicated in this House and he does it in a most articulate fashion.
  20.59169785971325
All I can say to him at this juncture, because I know this is a matter of continuing concern and activity by him, is that the CMO for olive oil is due to be reformed, as I indicated earlier, by 1 November 2001, following agreement in the Council and in this Parliament in adopting Regulation 1638/98.
  23.084429452980967
I cannot assume that if the situation were precisely as the honourable Member describes, and smaller producers were in a dangerously disadvantaged position by comparison with the big producers, there would have been such agreement in the Council and in this House.
  20.164340355774918
Therefore, I hope he will give attention to the results of the studies I mentioned being undertaken at the moment by the Commission, both in terms of the general questions he raised when he submitted his question and also in terms of the relative fortunes of big producers and small producers.
  16.57808926554486
Finally, as someone who is merely a consumer of olive oil, I hope there is no extensive dilution of what is one of my favourite complementary foodstuffs and that, whatever else we do in the European Community, we strive together with olive oil producers of all sizes to maintain the maximum quality.
  16.27626239415397
That is how we sustain our considerable lead in world markets.
  8.019861243049757
Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock, for your cooperation during this Question Time.
  22.67922339257392
We also congratulate you for using olive oil, which is very good for the health.
  11.29752099351935
I also say this from a Mediterranean standpoint.
  5.213501616240416
Question No 37 by (H-0409/00):
  6.509533382754797
Subject: Further integration entailed by EMU In the Commission's estimation, to what extent do the requirements imposed by EMU on economic policy - which include permanently fixed exchange rates - create the need for further economic integration in the form of a more extensive common budget (a common fiscal policy), cyclical transfers between Member States, increased labour mobility between the participating states and/or a more flexible labour market?
  22.65226306110122
The introduction of the euro will increase economic integration and reinforce the positive effects of the single market, primarily by eliminating the risks relating to exchange rates.
  16.13215616053547
There are also other factors. There is greater transparency in prices, an improvement in competition and an increase in trade and investment both cross-border and also between other countries or areas affected by monetary union.
  20.7059309783709
At the same time, as the common monetary policy will mean the same interest rate for all Member States of the monetary union, it will not only have an effect in terms of developing demand, but it will also mean greater integration of the financial markets.
  17.156232648421643
This should also bring benefits for savers and investors.
  11.247162662510467
For this to have the greatest positive effect, it is essential that we carry out a policy of rationalised public finances, which will not generate tensions in monetary policy itself, and at the same time, a decisive policy of structural reforms and a competition policy, which will allow the maximum benefit to be drawn from the process.
  19.140504697282154
In order for economic and monetary union to function successfully, we do not need a major budget which will allow cyclical transfers in the event of difficulties.
  13.229717893670745
I believe that the Treaty, supplemented by the Stability and Growth Pact, provides adequate instruments to implement an economic policy which is compatible with a unified monetary policy.
  14.818805296537075
The basic framework which we have introduced is a framework of mutual supervision of national fiscal policies and of coordination of economic policies by means of processes to improve our structural situations and the coordination or creation of a positive macroeconomic environment which will favour growth and employment, and at the same time reduce the possibility of asymmetric clashes caused by economic policies.
  17.56956216844287
Budgetary consolidation itself, which is, of course, the reduction of the public deficit, gives each Member State room to act in adverse situations.
  11.587592220367862
Greater labour mobility may certainly help to confront the problems which may arise in the event of asymmetric clashes.
  16.661954541667797
Both an increase in the available work force and an improvement in productivity would improve the situation in terms of creating jobs and helping to reduce unemployment.
  20.572608870720014
That is why we attach particular importance to labour mobility.
  13.371956978561826
The Commission has therefore insisted on its various strategies regarding the specific point of labour mobility, while remaining aware that this is a difficult issue.
  12.238447235034888
It is difficult within Member States and it is difficult between one Member State and another, due not only to historical and cultural incompatibilities in terms of education, but also to a series of other aspects related to this type of situation.
  20.10533470375119
Finally, I would say that clearly these difficulties which are being considered - and which may arise in the future - will surely be much less serious than those which have been brought up in theory by people who study monetary union, given that - and this is our experience to date - we are seeing an approximation of the economic policies of the countries and we have created room, in monetary terms, for us to confront difficulties more easily than in the past.
  21.50256140469011
Thank you very much for your answer which, up to a point, contains many of the features I had expected.
  16.98627286106351
I should like to follow up your answer and ask you what is meant by saying that the euro project will not be a success unless there is a large budget which can cope with fluctuations in the trade cycle.
  17.077232922153573
What kind of large budget?
  16.764533807842778
Is it a large EU budget which is being considered?
  17.361594292496985
I should also like to hear whether it can be imagined continuing with a policy based upon recommendations and exhortations to the euro zone countries.
  16.42053621778968
For example, Denmark has, in fact, on a number of occasions disregarded recommendations from the Commission.
  15.087456237109818
Is this state of affairs to be accepted in the long term or will the Stability and Growth Pact be followed up and a stable environment ensured for EMU by adopting working methods of a type different from those involving recommendations and exhortations?
  25.724830522546434
In your reply - or comment - I note two implicit questions.
  13.462620445901951
Firstly, a major budget is essential to tackle the cyclical difficulties.
  10.842760703113282
This would lead us into a very complex debate. The problems are not caused by clashes themselves, but by asymmetric clashes; asymmetric clashes differ depending on whether they are temporary or permanent, whether they relate to supply or demand.
  15.990377912277006
We have little experience to help us define a typology and lay down a single formula for resolving these difficulties by budgetary means.
  23.443259827807903
We believe that it is a much better idea to establish a general framework of economic health, of good economic behaviour, which will allow us to confront the difficulties in the case in question.
  21.043425375659655
In the future we will continue with recommendations to comply with the stability and growth pact.
  16.47423850225303
I do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing, but that is our obligation as the Commission.
  18.35104524883475
This is an agreement adopted by the Council of Ministers as a result of initiatives by certain Member States and which I also support, since I believe that a good budgetary policy provides greater room for manoeuvre in the event of difficulties.
  23.224425080447144
Earlier I referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the Member States.
  11.252255443655766
In this year' s recommendations we have taken particular account of the Commission' s own analyses regarding what the margins are, and which benchmarks we are setting in each of the Member States to tackle the crisis without exceeding the 3% public deficit, which is the figure we have established as a reference.
  14.656543535383097
We can see that that situation is different in each of the countries and, therefore, our recommendations and our comments will always be different in each of the countries, although this is not the only aspect that we take into consideration.
  17.029619175762686
Mr President, the current weakness and volatility of the euro is a cause of concern both within and outside the euro-zone.
  17.891104458465094
Does the Commissioner feel that the current stability pact and the powers of the European Central Bank are sufficient to force the Euro-land states to make the difficult and fundamental adjustments in their economic and labour markets, which are essential if the euro is going to be taken seriously by the global financial markets?
  14.52616664876355
I do not see any great correlation between the two questions, but I do note that the euro is being taken seriously.
  22.354850392348155
What has happened with the euro?
  5.0524666819246775
There are many technical explanations as to why we are in this situation.
  27.666886156469793
This would require a broader debate, focussing on the starting point, which is the development of economic forecasts and the real economies of each of the areas. It would also clearly concern changes in interest rates and certain other technical elements, such as expiry dates for certain types of issues etc.
  17.32591888913048
The reality is that, by analysing the euro on the basis, fundamentally, of the evolution of the exchange rate, we are making an incorrect evaluation of its introduction.
  17.438998997968305
The euro has been a great success, in terms of its introduction, in terms of issuing it as a currency, in terms of the consolidation of an excellent economic situation in Europe and in terms of the forecasts for the future.
  20.51705662368174
It is true that the interest rate is not what we would have liked.
  16.989077398580612
We believe that a strong economy means a strong euro.
  16.756121150240755
We also believe that the development of growth in Europe will be strong throughout 2000 and, as a result, we will match US growth by the end of this year.
  19.67661187157223
In these circumstances, we believe that the value of the euro will be rising in the coming months.
  15.22805248435883
Therefore, despite a certain degree of concern - because that concern exists within public opinion - about the evolution of the euro, we believe that this situation will be corrected and that it should be considered to be temporary rather than permanent.
  13.73238357881932
Mr President, in my opinion, the supplementary question by Mr Purvis was most pertinent, since recently the need for increased economic cooperation amongst the EMU countries has been justified by precisely this weakening of the value of the euro in relation to the US dollar.
  15.18749662197955
The reason for the dollar becoming stronger in comparison to the euro is simply that the national economy of the USA is stronger than that of the euro countries.
  17.258661480613544
Hundreds of thousands of new jobs have recently been created in the USA, while the number of jobs in Europe has been cut.
  16.763136466457702
I would like to ask the Commissioner firstly, whether the Commission admits that the weakening of the euro that has been much thrashed out in public, is a consequence of the infrastructural problems and lack of dynamism of the EU economy, particularly in relation to the USA, and whether he really believes that the kind of Keynesian action as proposed by Mrs Frahm would be the cure for this weakening of the euro, and whether he believes that the Commission will achieve better results in this matter, when the national governments of France and Germany have actually proceeded in the totally opposite direction, and their actions have weakened even further the competitiveness of the euro area.
  20.281105902357464
As an example, I refer here to the decisions made by the French Government on working hours.
  16.87676299511491
I will try to reply briefly, although these are complex questions and I will therefore have to give this point some attention.
  15.700615590579018
Firstly, with regard to increasing cooperation in terms of coordinating economic policies, I believe that it is necessary and positive and is one of the elements which is emerging from this current crisis.
  21.246350239201583
The French President has highlighted this and it will obviously be a point for debate during the next presidency.
  14.780991673601065
I do not agree with the theory that the euro' s development is leading to a fall in employment in Europe and an increase in employment in the USA.
  21.652526972455078
Transfers of capital may generate additional activity in the United States, but the positive increase in exports is generating activity in Europe.
  13.995829042252362
It would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue.
  15.881243664153224
In any event, what I do believe - as I said earlier - is that the euro, at the moment, has an exchange rate which, if we analyse it in relation to its components and its historical situation, is not that different from situations which have existed at other times.
  16.125893418803884
I am convinced that this is a transitional situation which will improve during this year.
  12.314750186079932
Question No 38 by (H-0419/00):
  8.298837873280284
Subject: Precarious employment and the industrial-accident rate in Spain and in the Murcia region At the Lisbon Summit, a commitment was made to achieving full employment in proper jobs throughout the EU.
  22.442268312467444
In response to the French Government' s proposal involving a reduction in working hours in order to create more proper, stable jobs, the approach agreed between the Spanish and UK Governments, which calls for further deregulation of employment conditions in order to increase the number of jobs, has been adopted.
  21.221260357754353
Spain' s experience over the last four years has demonstrated that jobs are indeed created but are predominantly casual and precarious in nature, and they are associated with a high rate of industrial accidents, the Murcia region being the part of Spain where that rate is highest.
  20.28517160144603
Does the Commission not think that there is an urgent case for monitoring the conditions under which jobs are being created in the various EU countries and regions, so as to ensure that job-creation is not at the expense of the stability and dignity of workers and especially of young people entering the job market for the first time?
  20.08519613464215
Questions to Mr Verheugen
  6.027243388662091
Mr President, despite the fact that I was born next to the Murcia region, it is difficult for me to analyse, in Community terms, the problems of the precarious employment there.
  18.196529355954045
Therefore, allow me to make a rather more general comment.
  18.341116515787892
The assessment of the labour market reforms which have resulted from the processes we have established in the Union - the Luxembourg process and the broad guidelines for economic policy - demonstrates that the reforms of the regulations on the labour market in the different countries are making a positive and significant contribution to greater economic growth and to promoting the creation of employment and the greater participation of men and women in the labour market.
  16.734728236218224
The broad guidelines of economic policy and the recommendations for employment have never advocated a simple deregulation of the labour market, as the question states.
  18.087826361379793
Together with the reform of certain labour market regulations, they also include, for example, the need to adopt measures which will promote entrepreneurial spirit or active labour market policies - and we state this quite deliberately - to improve employment opportunities.
  12.826050694750048
The measures adopted in each Member State must be adapted to the problems and reality of each of them.
  10.89399359527366
It is also quite normal for the Commission to insist on the need to hold debates and make agreements with social partners so that they may actively participate in the changes to the labour market in each country.
  20.773391292504545
As well as a significant and lasting increase in the levels of employment, one of the key priorities of the employment strategy is to improve the quality of jobs.
  17.871542358938697
The recent Lisbon Summit gave a new impulse to the Union' s economic and social agenda and we have also insisted on this point by talking of more and better employment.
  16.262065397663655
I would also like to highlight, as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now, the promotion and maintenance of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work, which has been one of the most prominent issues in the debate held in the Commission, which advocates better jobs in Europe.
  16.812431523182692
Labour market reforms directed at improving employment opportunities and workers' ability to adapt to these new opportunities in no way seek to undermine working conditions or health and safety at work.
  17.53985410211337
In accordance with its legal competence as laid down in the Treaty, the Commission has kept up the necessary efforts to implement and propose various legal instruments and monitor the incorporation of the acquis communautaire in this area.
  20.674262822103604
With regard to your specific question and the case of Spain, it is Spain' s responsibility, like the other Members, to apply the Commission' s directives.
  15.925433446689862
It is also the responsibility of the Member States to monitor the application of these directives in all of their regions.
  16.385784606991027
The Commission must guarantee that those directives are transposed into national law correctly and, clearly, to monitor all the issues relating to its application, which is the responsibility of the national authorities.
  15.983699760866303
I am grateful to Mr Solbes for the intention behind his reply, which is to safeguard and show concern for worker' s conditions.
  13.575518615696717
Nevertheless, the political analysis of the Lisbon Summit reveals that there were two proposals: one which was more social, more committed, which came from the French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, and the other, resulting from a previous agreement between Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, deregulating the labour market and making it more flexible. The latter proposal won the day.
  16.336408706061388
If we take Spain as an example, it is clear that job instability, temporary employment and work accidents are on the increase.
  16.183099325619676
Do you not therefore believe that it would be appropriate, in the review of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to incorporate the Social Charter with specific instruments and measures, as occurred with the five classic points of the Treaty of Maastricht, in order to guarantee full employment and employment quality and that it therefore not be left to the whim of each of the countries?
  18.421063414215865
By way of clarification, reference has been made to the number of work accidents in Murcia because it has such a sad record within Spain; that is why we are concerned.
  17.761953598833426
I imagined that was the reason for the reference to Murcia, and not the fact that I was born next to that province.
  17.624674985494327
With regard to the basic problem, I would make a different comment.
  17.045118104771092
Our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment.
  17.00912786577546
In the broad guidelines for economic policy for this year, and in the specific recommendation for Spain, we expressly refer to the need for the problems to be analysed, amongst them the cost of dismissal, which may be important with regard to temporary employment, because we believe that a distinction should be made between precariousness and flexibility, which are two very different things.
  16.322303086248017
Nevertheless, you introduced a second element in your supplementary question which, in my opinion, is of great interest: Why do we not establish the objective of full employment in the same way that we established the objectives of the Treaty of Maastricht at the time?
  22.366867543690763
Basically because they are two completely different types of figure.
  20.254083286623953
At Maastricht, what we put in place was compliance with obligations dependent on voluntary decisions adopted by the Member States which form the European Union.
  13.392345505252559
In the case of full employment, the figure is the consequence of measures which are intended to achieve an objective, but which do not have a causal relationship which guarantees its objective.
  18.523496080268007
What we can consider is what is being done in the various employment programmes, and that is the implementation of certain elements which will allow us to move towards full employment.
  20.23373054491955
When we spoke of full employment in the Commission document which served as a basis for the debate in Lisbon, we expressly said that if we add the development of the economy in accordance with currently available figures to the various determining factors and policies proposed by the Commission, full employment will be achieved.
  18.11270985414986
However, this cannot be a political objective, as in Maastricht, because it does not depend on the will of the different governments or on a specific decision by each one of them.
  18.71216321528478
I would like to say that, in order to judge from afar, it is often necessary to understand the reality.
  20.14181880716867
In the countries of the Southern Mediterranean, and specifically in the region of Murcia, they have, in recent years, stopped managing unemployment and started to manage employment.
  21.889023019860907
They have moved from an extraordinary and terrifying level of unemployment, originating in the great state industries whose economic model was unsustainable, through a crisis and then to a situation involving the growth of small businesses (SMBs) and economic incentives which have generated a new and vibrant model.
  15.976823436947498
However, it is clear that accidents in the workplace - which I am now talking about - are a problem of education and mutual responsibility on the part of businessmen, the state, public administration and, of course, trade unions.
  19.539638458945323
Unless they all work in unison, they will not achieve this objective.
  12.572551032499298
In Spain, back in 1995, a law was adopted in this respect, and they are trying to comply with it, but this cannot be achieved in a day.
  19.85655026745379
Therefore, Commissioner, firstly, what active policies and which economic sectors do you intend to bring into play in order to achieve better education in this particular area, so that a sense of responsibility may be developed?
  18.019981468705705
Secondly and very specifically: is there any programme to educate immigrants in the language of their host country, so that we can educate them to understand the minimum safety standards in this region which is host to many immigrants who do not speak our language?
  20.147159153613806
Thank you for your comments.
  6.137100643238537
With regard to your questions, I will say again that the distribution of responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States dictates that these matters fall to the Member States.
  16.748578745903824
Consequently, both the funding of these immigrant education programmes and the active policies are decisions which logically depend on which social policy the Spanish Government accepts or decides on.
  13.570699427610457
Question No 39 by (H-0352/00):
  10.01522344537221
Subject: Adaptation of the applicant countries Will the Commission indicate the total number of documents that have been sent to the applicant countries as well as the total volume of the 'acquis' and will it consider forms of cooperation that do not require the applicant countries to accept every rule?
  17.698018947357564
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the entire Community acquis, i.e. all the legal acts of the European Union without exception were sent to the candidate countries immediately after the resolution of the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997, during the course of screening.
  14.28260075606301
No-one has ever counted them and I cannot therefore tell you how many there are.
  15.603097694633167
We usually talk of just over 20 000 legal acts in this context.
  22.942735571156593
Mr President, there is not very much to thank the Commission for.
  13.503307440311188
I find it completely incomprehensible that there should be an institution which is unable to put together elementary statistics concerning the existing rules, which is unable to add up how much money is being sent to the candidate countries, which is unable to provide some general numerical information so that ordinary people can follow what is happening and which is unable to supply the total acquis on a CD-Rom to anyone who might be interested in it.
  18.814530388870118
It is really quite simple. I have worked on it for a good many years.
  27.231333148227563
It is completely impossible even for organisations with academic employees to find out how extensive the 'acquis' is, and it is apparently impossible for Mr Vanhengen to give the entire acquis to a Member of the European Parliament who is quite prepared to go through it and distribute the tasks among the different employees in order to see what positions are to be adopted on its various aspects.
  23.37225382052691
So there is nothing to thank the Commission for.
  18.460888953870377
Mr President, Mr Bonde, we have met each other face to face here before, and I personally am having to exercise a great deal of self-control in order to maintain the necessary degree of decorum in the House.
  14.446662207323861
The legal acts which we are talking about here are legal acts passed by the Council, by Parliament, by the Commission and by all the Community institutions.
  21.85169718297371
You, as a member of the most important legislative institution of the European Union know full well that these legal acts have not been numbered consecutively.
  11.612310230293057
I do not know of a single Member State of the European Union whose laws are numbered consecutively.
  10.380765512334438
Even the laws in your country - and I have taken the trouble of finding out - are not numbered consecutively.
  16.161368795400143
If you think that Commission officials are well employed if I sit them down and tell them to spend a week counting the legal acts issued since 1955, then let me tell you that I do not.
  15.981966021841764
I have no intention of arranging for them to be counted.
  16.968858633878494
The information which I have given you is as accurate as possible: i.e. that candidate countries are sent all, I repeat all the legal acts of the European Union without exception.
  22.6199183877711
I am curious to know how it helps if I tell you that this figure is 21334 or 21425.
  22.19328949819984
If you want, you sit down and do it. You can find the entire Community acquis on-line on the Celex website here in Parliament.
  13.783675115805877
You tell your employees to count these legal acts, because I shall not tell mine to do so.
  16.30476005750925
Mr President, Commissioner, the acquis is, of course, an important basis for accession.
  16.072973498926252
Can you tell us how acquis screening is proceeding in your view?
  11.111838889974434
With which candidate countries has most progress been made?
  12.43189107177728
Which chapters have been completed?
  9.124065583936455
Chancellor Schröder recently stated in a press conference that the first admissions will probably be in 2002.
  22.943216705275752
How do you assess the scenario if the legal inventory is completed in optimum time?
  10.938020340395262
What do you think is the earliest possible date for accession if optimum use is made of all deadlines and options?
  15.29569957457891
I can tell the honourable Member that screening - i.e. legislative adjustment - was of course completed with all candidates some time ago.
  14.276246108408822
It is updated now and again because the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are not idle and continue to produce legal acts, meaning that the acquis changes.
  15.226537483054699
This amended acquis must, of course, be included in negotiations.
  10.51142043626028
But this happens on a regular basis.
  10.436101978229932
The screening process has therefore been completed with all candidates.
  11.370777281856126
Your question is based on a misunderstanding.
  4.617576925486085
Screening is not the same as negotiation, screening is merely an adjustment process.
  21.546870393652537
Screening is used merely to identify the acquis of the European Union and how much of it already forms part of the candidate country' s legislation and how much does not.
  13.709561740664377
That has been done.
  11.514315330573972
Now you want to know how far negotiations have proceeded overall.
  17.260667844313055
I know that for the Luxembourg group of countries, with which negotiations started in March 1998, between 10 and 15 out of a total of 31 negotiating chapters have been provisionally completed.
  14.884331251452554
A few more will be completed during the Portuguese presidency.
  16.104517110714667
But more important than the number of chapters completed is probably the number of chapters opened.
  25.600577261268533
By the end of the Portuguese presidency, all 29 chapters will be on the negotiating table for the Luxembourg group of countries.
  13.900047967203658
Only the chapters entitled "Institutions" and "Miscellaneous" are still closed for obvious reasons.
  11.943440161609326
They come at the end.
  6.836241520153352
With the Helsinki group of countries, negotiations did not start until February of this year.
  15.995638442813123
Between 5 and 8 chapters will be opened for these countries during the Portuguese presidency.
  15.90373589921013
Indeed, I think that we will be able to provisionally close a whole series of chapters by the end of the Portuguese presidency, but we cannot yet forecast how many with any degree of accuracy.
  22.074508857107038
In all events, the process is proceeding apace.
  18.794087505928726
It is quite impossible to forecast when the negotiating process will be completed and when the first accessions will take place.
  15.299519219578993
There have been intensive discussions on this over recent weeks and months.
  8.446232588091998
The Commission stated quite clearly in Helsinki that an accession scenario could not be developed until all the information needed was available.
  11.320429233114307
We need to clarify if the Union itself is ready for accession, i.e. if the institutional reforms have been completed, how far negotiations have progressed and, most importantly, and this will be the most difficult exercise at the end, if a candidate country is judged to be in a position to really apply and implement the acquis it has adopted.
  19.614950615103243
As things stand today, I am bound to say that we cannot forecast when such a scenario will be ready.
  16.63049768671801
I have said on many occasions that I would like it to be ready by the end of this year, at the Nice summit.
  16.137930296726967
But whether or not that will be possible will only become apparent in the autumn of this year once we have the up-to-date progress reports on preparations for accession for each individual candidate country.
  15.652466430902063
Mr President, Commissioner, my question does not concern the timetable; instead I would like to ask a question regarding a principle of enlargement.
  18.126781696521657
The process of enlargement is expected to be a truly demanding one, in which there is a danger that we either become frustrated by long waiting times or compromise over the criteria by granting overlong transition periods, which will naturally cause displeasure in the old Member States.
  19.297824145290882
An arrangement such as the EEA agreement may be regarded as a solution of the past, but I would nevertheless like to ask, whether the Commission could, even in principle, consider a possible solution along the lines of the EEA agreement - not as it stands but of that nature - to be used as some sort of ' hatchery' or incubator for the new Member States prior to actual membership, instead of the applicant countries having to wait for long periods of time before permanent membership becomes a reality. I would further like to ask, whether the Commission shares the view that this kind of arrangement, along the lines of the EEA agreement, could considerably reduce the costs of enlargement and promote the economic development of the applicant countries.
  22.323478089799778
I hope this question was not an improper one at this time.
  15.476820272433816
Madam, what you wish to engage in now is a hypothetical discussion.
  15.355270400385463
This discussion was held in the first half of the 1990s and it culminated in resolutions of which you are aware, which were discussed on several occasions in Parliament and which can no longer be made retroactive, namely the resolution of the European Councils of Copenhagen, Essen and Luxembourg to prepare the Central and Eastern European Countries and Cyprus and Malta for full membership.
  22.767578695689647
There is no point today in debating whether or not there might have been an alternative.
  20.432032554105767
In any case, it is my recollection that the candidates were not satisfied with anything less.
  21.563800843519754
They would not have accepted less and would have seen it as discrimination, meaning that, in Luxembourg in 1997, there was no longer any realistic alternative to the resolution taken in any case.
  19.68724937224107
There is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should depart from this objective of full membership.
  17.358672386675785
If there were, I would know about it.
  17.738173526874064
But there is not.
  6.2589721999724395
All 12 countries with which we are negotiating are seriously working towards the goal of full membership and I urgently advise you against opening a debate on changing the fundamental objectives of enlargement now that the process has begun.
  16.212487000349086
The candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust.
  11.25580537533982
Question No 40 by (H-0388/00):
  18.58591016808982
Subject: Eastward enlargement: transitional arrangements regarding the free movement of services Negotiations with the first group of applicant states (the 'Luxembourg group' ) on the free movement of services have reached a provisional conclusion.
  17.428457197550305
What transitional arrangements have been agreed to date?
  8.831076468387739
What effects does the Commission expect these to have on small businesses and self-employed craft workers, particularly in the regions bordering on the applicant states?
  14.59115005618295
Questions to Mr Monti
  6.140951646467423
Mrs Müller, the question is based on an erroneous premise.
  11.620303287313485
The chapter entitled "Free movement of services" has not been provisionally completed with any candidate country.
  13.016481794978365
Nor do I expect this chapter to be completed with any country in the immediate future.
  21.52223570315178
Mr President, it is certainly correct to say, Mr Verheugen, that the chapter has not been completed, but negotiations have started.
  12.264019557882298
However what I am interested in is this: Have transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services been applied for during these negotiations?
  30.516909798739192
You know, I am from a border region and I know exactly what the situation is on the ground.
  16.723212002553907
I am convinced that medium-sized companies and the craft industry will face huge problems and enormous challenges when it comes to the free movement of services, because there is a huge wage differential of 1:10 at present.
  15.71810555596225
You yourself know full well which industries are affected.
  11.434894270488419
Is there any intention on the European side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services?
  20.239208730894134
The Czech Republic has already applied for transition periods for the acquisition of land by foreigners and this will have an impact on services.
  17.42572084094276
What is your position on the transition periods which the Czech Republic has applied for and what is the Commission' s position in general on this point?
  18.08588619964031
Mr President, Mrs Müller, I assume that you know that accession negotiations take the form of a state conference at which the Member States, not the Commission, negotiate and I am not therefore entitled to divulge the content of negotiations which have not yet been completed.
  23.409956928571138
I would gladly do so, but I am not allowed to.
  14.856547820712182
However, I can still answer the question, because the Commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised.
  8.775684450014632
First, the Commission takes the view that transition periods should only be considered during the enlargement process if the aim of enlargement cannot otherwise be achieved within the required time or by the required date.
  17.742698092785766
Transition periods must be very, very limited in both scope and duration, especially where the internal market is at stake.
  12.09503301355261
You must know that every transition period, irrespective of whom it benefits, suspends the internal market for that area.
  21.684615546473204
And if a large number of transition periods are agreed, then we can forget the whole idea of the internal market for years to come.
  17.86187296903503
That cannot be the meaning of enlargement.
  7.334936387048817
The question which you actually want answered is the question of how we can prepare for the problems which will arise in certain border regions following enlargement.
  14.286467843118633
The region which you come from and the region which I come from are just such regions.
  14.360513063961498
I have discussed this matter on many occasions in your country, as you know, and so I can be brief.
  21.50082589895429
I think that there may well be transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, which is the really difficult question.
  18.899155479019882
But we have not yet reached that point.
  11.717365034933128
In the area of the free movement of services, which will lead to stiffer competition in border regions, I think that we need to start preparing an action programme right now, particularly so that small and medium-sized enterprises in border regions will be capable of adapting to and withstanding this new competition.
  17.91736811514271
When, a few weeks ago, I once again read the Commission' s progress report on Lithuania, it occurred to me that the progress reports are being produced as if it were the previous enlargement we were talking about, that is to say the enlargement which took place before the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force.
  20.453111853805506
The Social Chapter is the corollary and counterpart of free movement of services and labour mobility.
  17.042870891194703
My question is about whether the forthcoming progress reports will, to a greater degree than the previous reports, take account of employment and of the Social Chapter, which is now a part of our 'acquis' .
  17.015453222167192
I believe, in fact, that we can succeed in enlarging the Union if we combine these two aspects: firstly, the free movement of services and employees and, secondly, more equal conditions when it comes to the dialogue between employers and employees.
  19.305672203508824
The Social Chapter is, in fact, a part of our common regulations, with which the candidate States must also comply.
  15.361600033510175
I would like to remind MEPs in general that questions during Question Time must be specific questions on specific issues, which lead to specific answers.
  17.71757576100438
Everything else must take place during the normal debates of the parliamentary committees, because, otherwise, the MEPs who are due to follow will not be able to put their questions.
  11.786704728453811
Having given this general warning, I give the floor to the Commissioner.
  13.630818235932606
Mr President, to be honest, the underlying question was how many legal acts does the European Union have.
  18.625671096420092
Now I am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country.
  18.85724285512237
I really cannot see the connection between these two questions, except that both relate to enlargement.
  13.582024993787941
However, if you take the view that there is a connection, then I am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so.
  19.661038544007198
All the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries.
  8.51603819613063
The Charter of Fundamental Rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready.
  15.426155907702178
It is only now being drafted and its legal status has not yet been recognised.
  9.898967819471542
I know no better than you if this Charter will become part of the Treaty or if it will be no more than a solemn declaration.
  13.73577057409094
If this Charter should become part of the Treaty, it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the details of this Charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned.
  15.010734948142026
We must also report in the progress reports - as you will have noticed - as to whether a country is complying with the Copenhagen criteria.
  19.800126241946444
That basically answers the questions, because the political criteria of Copenhagen basically cover everything which will appear in this Charter of Fundamental Rights and these questions have also been answered in relation to Lithuania and will be answered in the next progress report on Lithuania.
  12.592545633225358
Mrs Thors is raising a point of order.
  17.269120688903655
I wish to point out that I was not earlier referring to Mrs Thors, but to all MEPs, but you have the floor.
  32.35840055026979
I would ask you not to enter into a debate with the Commissioner.
  16.24782471514333
Commissioner, I just want to clarify matters as there seems to be very bad interpretation - I was not talking about the Charter of Fundamental Rights but about the Social Charter including the rights of workers.
  20.384801615131497
These include working conditions which I think are a corollary to the movement of services.
  15.857364181469476
What are the conditions under which services are provided?
  10.996529576965903
What are the conditions under which people are working?
  6.955971210228949
That is the corollary of free movement.
  21.674119292924917
Mr President, I did indeed hear the words Charter of Fundamental Rights.
  10.405245039580153
Of course, the Social Charter forms part of the Treaty and is therefore negotiated with all candidate countries.
  20.39762973688326
It forms part of the Community acquis.
  9.929649298888172
We report on how the individual candidate countries are preparing to apply the acquis, i.e. to apply the Social Charter.
  11.072617128955619
I am not at the moment in a position to tell you exactly how things stand with Lithuania in particular, but I would be more than happy to give you a written reply specifically on Lithuania and the Social Charter.
  15.618192497336945
Commissioner, we were in fact discussing the matter of transition periods.
  17.909427464055554
I should like to ask what your position is on the wishes of Poland and the Czech Republic to introduce long transition periods for two areas of concern to them, namely the free acquisition of land, including farmland, and the freedom of establishment.
  20.543766151914994
These are two very fundamental points and I should like to know what the Commission or your position is on this.
  15.62156300058208
I also wanted to ask you what you think about linking transition periods in the Member States and the candidate countries in the sort of package deal that is constantly being discussed.
  14.684326801024671
On the first question, I should like to say that the Member States still have no negotiating position on this question, nor is there any Commission draft on it.
  14.527872152021876
My own personal opinion is irrelevant.
  7.369693889673109
In any case, I cannot explain it to the European Parliament until the institutions have formed their own opinion.
  24.027658622473997
As far as linking transition periods is concerned, this happens automatically.
  22.543756659408384
We shall have a so-called "play off" at the end of the negotiations between the wishes which the Member States still have and the wishes which the candidates have.
  18.28904081186059
Basically their wishes concern transition periods.
  6.800447636613938
Irrespective of whether or not that is what it is formally called, you can imagine how this sort of negotiation process proceeds.
  17.11166091348085
It will be a negotiation and one of the principles of negotiation is that one side makes a concession so that the other side also makes a concession and an overall compromise must be found in the end which takes accounts of the wishes of both sides.
  22.257475628284727
Highly specific packages - if that was your question - whereby we also say: we are linking the wish for transition periods on the one side to the wish for transition periods on the other side are not feasible in my opinion.
  19.241570248892327
I should draw your attention to the fact that the question of transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, for example, only gives cause for concern in two of the fifteen Member States.
  26.45727626104983
It is a German problem and it is an Austrian problem.
  10.194628898047231
It is not a problem for the other thirteen which is why I cannot predict exactly how this issue will be handled in the final stage of negotiations.
  16.13893251512607
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner, for your replies.
  8.782577123024293
Questions Nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing.
  16.795134126588014
Mr Titley has the floor for a point of order.
  11.189439584037194
- Mr President, you realise this is the second month running you have done this to me - cut me off as my question was coming up.
  16.1201257799185
Yet you have allowed speakers to speak for over one minute including a rather long and pointless dialogue about the merits of Murcia.
  19.78399512758398
Also in the rules as I recall, you are only allowed to take one supplementary question per political group and these rules are being broken and as a consequence, for the second week running, I miss out on a question.
  18.702999412106077
I think it is absolutely outrageous and I will be writing to the President to complain.
  17.566428289306746
Mr Titley, I will reply briefly so as not to inconvenience the other MEPs.
  12.479697655315633
I am not getting at you.
  9.442001384914962
What has happened is that the 20 minutes devoted to Mr Verheugen have run out and it is now Mr Monti' s turn to reply, and he has been waiting some time.
  21.094313316138695
With regard to the Rules of Procedure, I must tell you that there are two supplementary questions, not one.
  28.585856308535636
Please read the Rules of Procedure.
  10.691349636579856
There are two questions.
  5.753960061063659
I am not going to get into a debate.
  11.863505654399791
You may write the letter you mentioned and you will receive a polite and full reply, but please do not worry since my intention was to give you the floor within the time allotted.
  16.438525000366027
Question No 43 by (H-0354/00):
  19.427238664768762
Subject: Applications by Member States regarding state aids Is the Commission happy about the speed with which it deals with applications by Member States to provide state aids?
  17.71085522332981
The time-limits for the Commission to take a decision on aid projects notified by a Member State are laid down in Council Regulation 659/1999.
  22.262986465399017
In most cases the Commission can close the examination of the notified aid project after the preliminary examination, that is without opening a formal investigation.
  12.53971113710189
Such decisions must be taken within two months following the receipt of a complete notification.
  16.653278556727148
In practice, notifications are frequently incomplete so that the Commission is forced to request additional information before it can take a decision.
  21.960803968298677
In order to further reduce this type of unnecessary delay, the Commission has prepared detailed standard notification forms for certain types of aid - regional, training, R&D, etc. and will continue to do so where appropriate.
  18.084439827661363
When doubts are raised about the compatibility of an aid project with the common market, the Commission must open a formal investigation for which the regulation provides an indicative time-limit of 18 months.
  15.601284181627333
The Commission would certainly prefer to be able to reduce this time-limit.
  10.933665229519603
However, this seems at present not feasible for different reasons.
  13.786995240245165
Firstly, considerable time is needed for translation and publication of the decision, for third parties to submit observations and for the Member States to comment on these observations.
  15.835954123040729
Secondly, the cases for which a formal investigation is opened are usually very complex and therefore require a longer period of examination, often also involving meetings with the Member State concerned and modifications to the original project.
  19.94684666581679
Nevertheless, the Commission considers that given the absence of any time-limit for the formal investigation procedure before the regulation, the regulation has already brought some progress.
  16.824206763872333
The Commission is also considering new ways of improving the efficiency and speed of state aid procedures.
  16.848445349549554
In this regard, the group exemption regulations, which are currently being prepared for aid to SMEs - training aid and de minimis aid - should be mentioned.
  19.44195458142006
Once they are in force, Member States will no longer need to notify aid projects complying with the conditions of the exemption regulations but can grant the aid immediately.
  14.51747080914525
This will considerably simplify state aid procedures.
  13.281248231109032
I wish to thank the Commissioner for that very full answer and, in particular, for the last part where he indicates that the Commission is looking at speeding up and, where possible, giving fast-track approval for state aids.
  17.319820637958127
However, in some Member States there is still a serious problem created by delays in decision-taking on state aids.
  23.27848805050943
I am convinced that some jobs have been lost because waiting for the decision on state aid has meant that a company has gone out of business in the end because it did not have the approval in time.
  21.697429324194303
In terms of the delay, is the Commission of the opinion that the reorganisation that is currently going on will provide new resources and assistance to him in his attempts to speed up the processing of state aids, or does the problem lie, as he partly indicated, with the Member States in the inadequate information provided by some of them when they make an application?
  15.885769498848337
As you know, Mr Martin, we are working in a number of directions concerning state aid and in order to make state aid control more stringent.
  19.093642080529122
As to time limits, there are no plans to change the time limits in the near future.
  17.052670888379343
The deadlines are laid down in a Council regulation, which for the first time codifies state aid procedures, and since that regulation was only adopted in 1999 it is not likely to be modified in the near future.
  17.81616732770519
However, we are prepared and indeed willing to try to speed up certain aspects of the decision-making wherever possible, for example preparing the standard notification forms.
  20.525530603534808
You mentioned the problem of resources.
  7.958808802370235
Of course, this is a key problem for the whole of the competition policy activities and that includes state aid.
  28.63467699771334
The better the quality of information provided to begin with by Member States in their notifications, the more likely it is that the process will be smooth and conducted in a relatively short time scale.
  16.918206308205168
Question No 44 by (H-0355/00):
  10.562928750267696
Subject: State aids to nuclear power Given that the electricity market came into effect in February last, subjecting all electricity production to the rules of the internal market, and that the nuclear common market under Article 92 of the Euratom Treaty does not include electricity as a product, does the Commission agree that electricity generated using nuclear energy is now subject to the same internal market rules as all other forms of electricity?
  15.984588509312504
Does the Commission therefore consider that all state aids to the nuclear industry are prohibited by the EC Treaty, given that no derogation is specified, and that Article 98 of the Euratom Treaty does not provide for a subsidised accident insurance scheme for nuclear risks?
  18.309994122803367
In this context what proposals, if any, has the Commission made to the UK Government concerning their NFFO system under Article 87 of the EC Treaty?
  17.250726162347938
Can the Commission now confirm that it is investigating state aids to the nuclear industry as requested by the Green/EFA Group in its letter to Commissioner Monti of 10 March?
  17.671667534273002
Mr President, the Commission shares the opinion of the honourable Member to the effect that the liberalisation of the electricity market affects all types of electricity, including electricity generated using nuclear energy.
  22.530083157277772
The Commission considers that there are no grounds for interpreting the EC or the Euratom Treaty as necessarily prohibiting all state aids to the nuclear industry.
  19.91512657295888
The Euratom Treaty does not include any clauses specifically prohibiting state aid.
  6.400356146311206
Moreover, while Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty do provide for a general principle prohibiting state aids, they also authorise specific categories of state aid.
  15.451716616380404
It would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case.
  16.301426709680634
The Commission has not made any proposals to the UK Government on the subject of the NFFO system in application of Article 88 of the EC Treaty.
  19.763348371143195
As regards any existing aid to the nuclear industry, the Commission is not undertaking any systematic investigation.
  20.144346426659908
If, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to the attention of the Commission, such cases will be dealt with in compliance with the terms of the relevant articles of the EC and Euratom Treaties.
  10.848674868367766
Commissioner, thank you for your response, but I must admit I find it hard to grasp the logic of it.
  18.193797331879946
On the one hand, regarding state aid to the environment, you expect to implement a very thorough analysis of the subsidies to renewable energies even though it is clear that, for the time being, this sector is at a disadvantage due to the internalisation of costs.
  12.624909983020466
In other words, the market share of renewable energies within the current electricity market is barely 5%.
  15.500400120997758
Alongside that, nuclear energy amounts to 30% of the market but in this case you do not plan any systematic investigation.
  17.91189932256658
I do not therefore see how we can possibly understand this, if the logic of your energy policy is supposed to be fair, treating all forms of electricity production alike.
  18.53362915250209
I must therefore ask you to justify your position since, as far as I am concerned, and also many others, most especially the renewable energy industry, it is a position which is extremely difficult to comprehend.
  20.375480925917582
Thank you, Mr Turmes.
  6.785901430485842
I am very aware of environmental requirements, as I was even in the previous Commission, when I proposed the directive on the taxation of energy products, and I try to adopt the same approach in my activities within the Prodi Commission.
  21.12124375662049
I very clearly understand your concern, but permit me some observations.
  14.332415681130898
The proposed new framework for state aid to the environment is very flexible with regard to the granting of aid to renewable energies.
  15.146738011721336
It authorises aid of at least 40% of eligible costs in the case of investment, and for operational aid the Member States are entitled to adopt a system authorising aid up to 100% of eligible costs.
  13.564652163299385
I do not think, therefore, that you can accuse the Commission of banning aid to renewable energies.
  17.71868960645065
There is some competition, again permit me the observation, not only between renewable energies as opposed to conventional energies, but also between the various forms of renewable energies.
  21.59443458072116
Aid to these forms of energy may, moreover, vary according to the Member States.
  13.395670675402513
Unregulated aid would therefore engender distortions of competition, which could have an adverse impact primarily on certain forms of renewable energy.
  15.740044831310422
The Commission recognises that renewable energies may need support in order to be able to develop but, at the same time, it is also important for these forms of energy to adapt gradually to competitive markets in order to ensure their long-term development.
  16.811306139081893
Question No 45 by (H-0383/00):
  8.564950948332378
Subject: Financial aid given to the European nuclear industry What assessment has been made by the Commission of the financial aid given to the European nuclear industry - in the form of support for Euratom and the Joint Research Centres - in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the European Union?
  23.312876588601867
Community action within the context of the Euratom Treaty complies with the provisions of the Treaty and relates, in particular, to the financing of the Commission's tasks: protection against radiation, monitoring safety and research.
  18.781009662424978
As far as the latter is concerned, Community programmes for nuclear research are established by the Council which, pursuant to Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty, acts unanimously on Commission proposals.
  13.49909146642781
In this context, the activities of the JRCs are intended, in conformance with its mission, to increase protection and nuclear safety, and in particular, provide scientific and technical assistance to the competent directorates-general.
  26.20401184335477
Article 305 (ex Article 232) of the EC Treaty establishes that the provisions of this Treaty do not derogate from the Euratom Treaty.
  15.423987988401862
This is particularly true in the case of the competition rules, which do not derogate from the framework established by the Euratom Treaty regarding Community nuclear research.
  19.557107142986606
Therefore, the Community research policy under the Euratom Treaty does not contradict the competition rules laid down by the EC Treaty.
  25.884087830753177
Commissioner, you have failed to answer my question.
  9.798221980817212
I want to know what assessments you are making on financial aid.
  15.553706902026304
This relates to the previous question by Mr Turmes as well and the answer you gave to that in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the EU.
  17.697298842988424
I conclude from your answers both to my question and the previous one that here we have not just a white elephant in the nuclear industry in Europe but a holy cow.
  19.17904252985058
You can provide state aids that are untouchable, even by a Commissioner as powerful as yourself!
  15.028929712911033
But let me ask you what exactly is the situation?
  9.393459193583514
You said that under the Treaties there are derogations - and you quoted the Euratom Treaty.
  15.854867059965057
There is clearly a distortion between Member States because of the state aids.
  10.5758114973284
Where exactly in the Treaty are the written permissions for these state aids?
  14.308538116587313
Could you elaborate on that please?
  4.784662706279347
I shall try, Mrs Ahern.
  6.658434375725216
First of all, if you allow me, I have here a note in French.
  20.389288695496514
I should like to emphasise that the Commission does not rule out applying the rules of Community law on competition to public interventions in favour of nuclear electricity producers.
  22.710042787759154
In its illustrative nuclear programme according to Article 40 of the Euratom Treaty, in particular, the Commission very clearly indicated that "Developments towards the liberalisation of the Community internal electricity market will mean that nuclear energy will have to compete in the same framework and under the same conditions as all other energy sources."
  18.381697810069728
A full implementation of the internal market and a rigorous application of the relevant state aid and competition rules implies a level playing field for all energy sources.
  16.434965716698848
Once this principle has been established, it is up to the Commission to investigate on an individual basis any allegations according to which the nuclear sector is in receipt of subsidies engendering unfair competition.
  25.844615084162967
I may add that the services I am directly responsible for within the Commission are of the opinion that it is necessary to keep to a strict interpretation of the Treaty.
  13.680253074314237
Competition rules are applicable to all electricity producers, including the nuclear sector, insofar as they do not depart from the terms of the Euratom Treaty.
  16.94448107051663
I consider this position to be all the more justifiable since the directive liberalising the internal electricity market does not stipulate any specific rule for nuclear producers and does not make any distinctions on the grounds of the source of the electricity produced.
  19.757547942546534
Commissioner, you say that neither the Treaty nor the directive on the internal electricity market stipulate any exemptions regarding subsidies to the nuclear sector.
  23.550793263654626
On what part of the Treaty, then, is the exemption that you are still allowing the nuclear industry based?
  19.09469844001409
Articles 87 and 88 make no reference to nuclear energy.
  17.157522432691472
So it is not very clear what your legal basis is for exemptions for electricity generated using nuclear energy.
  10.265103269907826
I believe I have given you all the information available to the Commission on the subject.
  14.874424701403692
I can add that, on the operational level, as indeed I think I said in response to your own question, Mr Turmes, on existing aid to the nuclear industry, the Commission is not undertaking a comprehensive investigation.
  23.005436862805052
If, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to our attention, then these cases will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the two treaties.
  28.73037571654944
I would further like to add that in the logical overall construction of the EC Treaty, the articles governing state aid, i.e. Articles 87 and 88, are not restricted to specific sectors.
  18.160814099434806
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 46 to 83 will be replied to in writing.
  14.636023101896805
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
  7.591203690793977
(The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
  9.415043644470959
Carbon dioxide emissions from new cars
  5.500157734058246
The next item is the report (A5-0128/2000) by Mr González Alvarez, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars.
  11.955683524205963
Mr President, there are few of us here at this time in the evening, but it is also true that this is the third time we have debated this report in the European Parliament.
  20.10971573277342
On the first occasion, in December 1998, this report on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars was approved at first reading with 48 amendments.
  13.584871999855348
Of those 48 amendments, the Council and Commission accepted some in their entirety and others only in part.
  12.73172718694811
The report therefore returned for a second reading.
  13.331319128007639
The Council had accepted certain amendments which we considered to be important, but there remained certain aspects of the report and the amendments approved unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - and by a large majority in plenary session - which we also considered to be important and which had not been accepted.
  20.366194090424884
We are basically talking about the inclusion, in this scheme to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars, of lightweight industrial cars, which are used widely within cities and whose carbon dioxide emissions also pollute.
  14.908564563908403
It also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data.
  13.43995534951917
For a scheme of this nature, rigour and comparability, in terms of the data collected by the governments, are essential.
  21.01766391119652
It also seemed very important that we maintained something that was traditional in the positions of the Committee on the Environment: a certain degree of precaution in relation to voluntary agreements.
  19.825310743309522
If we bear in mind that Community Law - directives and regulations - is often not complied with, it seems to us all the more unlikely that voluntary agreements will be complied with.
  23.82189578435388
The Committee on the Environment had little faith in these voluntary agreements and another amendment asked for the establishment of a clear legal framework which would come into play in the event that the voluntary agreements failed.
  20.257733987423382
They also finally accepted our concern that one of the paragraphs should not only mention the stabilisation of emissions, but also their reduction.
  26.48588547737628
Another amendment which we felt was important concerned the dimensions of vehicles.
  10.735702866936167
Mr President, in total, 10 amendments were approved by a substantial majority in this House and then not accepted by the Council, and we therefore had to embark on this conciliation procedure, which I must point out has been neither difficult nor controversial.
  17.866670261658637
As its very name indicates, the conciliation procedures require each of the parties to give some ground so that a final agreement can be reached.
  22.724958037095966
In this final agreement, our main concerns have been addressed.
  13.412869228716515
It includes a study of the future inclusion of lightweight industrial vehicles, the possibility of shortly presenting a proposed legal framework and reviewing the data with a view to making them more rigorous and more or less equivalent in each of the countries.
  19.136799012438985
In short, Parliament' s main concerns have been taken up, if not in an immediate and radical manner, at least to the extent that a commitment has been given to adopt decisions on this issue in the future.
  21.928935347475733
The only amendment which was not accepted was the one relating to dimensions of vehicles.
  15.635447496375575
Parliament continued to insist that this was very important because the more powerful and larger the vehicle, the greater its level of emissions, and we considered it important that this be included in one of the annexes.
  15.718158534029204
However, bearing in mind that another six issues relating to the capacities and conditions of the vehicles have been accepted, we felt that we could not prolong the conciliation process any longer, particularly considering that we want this study on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars to be implemented immediately in each of the countries.
  19.36148183912194
Finally, I believe that this is a reasonable agreement, which is neither Parliament' s nor the Council' s initial proposal.
  22.249840754780404
Mr President, I believe that we will have no problem ensuring that this agreement is approved.
  11.509527387984189
Mrs González Álvarez, conciliation processes vary in difficulty, I can assure you.
  11.558724093710715
I am glad that this one has gone smoothly.
  5.8826500632169285
Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to start by congratulating Mrs González Álvarez.
  23.604856202354178
She really is most persistent, because we had a very good report at second reading as it was, but she was determined to incorporate more proposed amendments and I really must congratulate her on succeeding in doing so.
  12.780488460215556
Parliament has asserted itself against the Council once again.
  7.414043473405824
The introduction of this sort of monitoring scheme is just one of the many steps on the path towards compliance with the Kyoto protocol.
  16.001115990414196
Reducing greenhouse gases by 8% in comparison with 1990 is therefore the main objective between now and the year 2012.
  13.848140093746274
The dramatic change in the climate has been noticeable here in Strasbourg over the past two days and is far greater than we assumed.
  15.453724344626924
It will therefore come as no surprise if we adopt this report unanimously tomorrow, as will certainly be the case, and that the Council and Parliament have been able to find a common position so quickly.
  14.66010500761685
This joint monitoring scheme is the first of its kind and I think that its success or failure will decide whether or not we opt to introduce other similar schemes.
  16.952639897958157
We have taken recourse to a three-part strategy in order to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption: environmental agreements with the car industry, a system of tax incentives and a system of labelling for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
  19.710887062029467
But despite all these efforts, directives and joint measuring schemes, we should not delude ourselves: we are unlikely to achieve the target objective of reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels.
  19.258294915361457
Some experts are advising us to try and stabilise emissions at present levels.
  11.519328447130157
That may well be pessimistic but if we consider that the number of cars on the road is continuing to rise in the 14 Member States, oh excuse me, I meant 15; we Austrians often have to stop and ask ourselves if there are 14 or 15 Member States, but there are in fact still 15, and if we consider enlargement to the east and if we consider that people in China and India also want to live as we do, then we should make no mistake: it will be difficult to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases or CO2 and we should therefore make every effort to stabilise them at the very least.
  18.856180797954305
Despite all the pessimism, introducing a pan-European monitoring system for CO2 emissions will not do any harm.
  22.977996055328376
Let us try yet again with one small step at a time and perhaps the House will sit in 2005, when we need to examine the initial results, and complain that perhaps we did not do enough today.
  17.966188929530922
Mr President, Commissioner, trust is good, control is even better, as the Head of State of a now defunct system used to say.
  19.446049281009635
Nonetheless, once in a while these words of wisdom fit the bill because our CO2 strategy for cars is of course a new departure in that we are trusting in the willingness of car manufacturers in Europe, Korea and Japan to take voluntary technical measures to reduce CO2 emissions from their cars to 140g by 2008, which will represent a reduction of around 25%.
  17.801652596535256
But we do still need a control mechanism so that we can intervene if necessary.
  17.391263330802904
Hence: trust is good, control is even better.
  6.510996581321879
We want a statistically perfect control instrument at our disposal and in this respect I thank the rapporteur for her persistence in establishing a reasonable control instrument for CO2 emissions from cars in Europe which applies to all Member States, which clearly shows which vehicles are registered where and what their CO2 emissions are, so that we can see clearly in 2003 if the manufacturers' undertakings are being respected or not.
  22.463465205602144
And if they are not, then we must take legislative measures.
  14.930583267377774
I should like to refer to another two pillars in our strategy: the question of labelling, which has been dealt with and the question of additional tax incentives for low-consumption vehicles, which is still a somewhat weak point.
  17.764145661937036
I think that all of us, especially of course the Member States, need to give clear additional incentives, so that we really can achieve our objective of 120 g in 2005.
  20.559616293399383
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on the excellent results that she has achieved and to begin by placing this report in the broader context of climate change.
  19.69413197881361
Since the Rio de Janeiro Conference and then Kyoto, the European Union has always led the political side of the debate on climate change.
  16.426303113339745
Nevertheless, although Europe continues to lead the debate in terms of rhetoric, it is beginning to lose the legitimacy to do so in a credible way.
  26.580865138104837
It is rather pointless for the European Union to try to alarm the whole world with this problem when, in reality, the European greenhouse gas bubble, in particular the carbon dioxide bubble, is more likely to increase by 6% to 8% than to decrease by the 8% that we agreed in Kyoto.
  15.282043702034935
It is therefore time to take internal action in order to lend credibility to our external efforts.
  21.239405868577702
In terms of political action, the transport sector must be our priority for the following two fundamental reasons.
  25.17245083863187
Firstly, because, according to the Green Paper published by the European Commission, this sector will not be part of the European trading system for carbon dioxide emissions, and all greenhouse gas reductions will therefore have to be achieved exclusively through national and Community policies and measures.
  17.122453919072047
Secondly, because transport is the sector that is contributing most to Europe' s falling short of the levels set in Kyoto.
  13.116877668480681
According to a study recently published by the European Environment Agency, transport is responsible for almost 30% of the European Union' s total emissions, and it predicts that the level of carbon dioxide emissions generated by this sector will increase by 39% of the 1990 level by 2010.
  16.494368162022457
Given this extremely disturbing picture, which shows that road transport is responsible for 85% of total carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector, and given the overwhelming need for action, the agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee on this system for monitoring CO2 emissions from light passenger vehicles is to be welcomed.
  16.7806307982538
This system is a crucial aspect in the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and will ensure rigorous control of the voluntary commitment made by the car industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in new passenger vehicles by 25%.
  15.984628486028077
I regret the fact that it has not been possible to include light commercial vehicles in this system.
  15.852035255535144
In any event, I congratulate Mrs González Álvarez once again on the results she has achieved.
  23.973495466287456
Mr President, Commissioner, I intend to be as brief as our successful rapporteur in the conciliation procedure.
  11.649830125803613
However, let me just offer her my hearty congratulations on her excellent report and brilliant success, as some of the previous speakers have done.
  15.257744514698462
Contrary to some previous speakers, I think it is most important that the report should seek not just to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases but to reduce them, especially given the fact that we need to achieve a demonstrable success by 2005 under the terms of the Kyoto protocol.
  18.878964741037326
I think it is fundamental, given the reservation which this Parliament has always expressed in connection with voluntary obligations in environmental agreements, that we have managed to include the passage stating that data will be used from 2003 onwards to monitor the voluntary obligations of the car industry.
  20.964494896094145
I also think that it is fundamental - and the scope is not extended by this decision - that we have managed to bring the Commission so far down the line that it is looking into implementing harmonised measurements for the specific CO2 emissions from class N1 vehicles and presenting proposals to this effect.
  17.088972910144847
I think that is a huge success.
  6.347940017573996
I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report.
  14.224561739076082
Mr President, I welcome the excellent result reached by the European Parliament and the Council on this dossier.
  22.518115788321694
I congratulate the co-legislators on their efforts in finding a swift and satisfactory agreement.
  8.739928448680654
The process leading to the approval of this proposal constitutes a prime example of how the two arms of the European legislature can settle their differences and work together towards adoption of sound and effective environmental law.
  21.680080325410422
I should like to seize the opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for its constructive approach.
  17.912269578687503
The adoption of this decision will allow the effectiveness of the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars to be monitored and, more specifically, it will provide credible data to monitor the implementation of the voluntary agreements with car manufacturers.
  14.359868459630972
This strategy is one of the most concrete activities of the Community on CO2 emissions and reductions from the transport sector.
  18.723607811977597
Therefore it represents an important milestone in the achievement of the Kyoto target.
  13.050060186943085
Mr President, unforgivably, I have forgotten something.
  9.76695000990849
It will take me just 20 seconds to express my gratitude to all the members of the Conciliation Committee: to Mr Provan, to Mrs Jackson, who also participated, and to the members of the Commission and the Council with whom we worked in order to reach an agreement on the report.
  14.999635910727395
Furthermore, I would like to thank all the MEPs for their support.
  14.637454877299572
The debate is closed.
  9.306012098163244
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
  11.636574262901071
Interoperability of the trans-European rail systems
  10.424006980704707
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports, tabled by Mr Savary on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:
  22.89286892444014
(A5-0112/2000) on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation and effects of Directive 96/48/EC concerning the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system;
  15.488118487579229
(A5-0113/2000) on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system.
  20.22617453216312
Mr President, I hope that the two members due to speak before me were not travelling by train and have been delayed.
  14.024145646703765
I think they are in the House and will arrive in time.
  22.927606246625707
Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that we are fighting numerous problems on the railways which are a legacy from the past.
  18.567443866259207
For example, in 1970, the railways' share of the freight traffic market was 21%, compared with just 8.5% now.
  20.467776446833973
The railways have lost out massively in freight traffic and their share of the passenger traffic market has fallen from 10 to 6%.
  12.094115722683634
The winner has been road freight traffic, which is increasing constantly and winning market shares: 16% per annum on the eastern borders of Austria, for example.
  24.14885485059238
It is now 2.4 times higher than in 1990.
  10.256014705314696
If you take lorries and buses from eastern Europe on the A1 motorway, which is the most important east-west route, traffic increased sixfold between 1995 and the year 2000.
  13.936708883728585
In other words, freight traffic, especially transit freight traffic, is growing massively.
  14.499726463347372
According to forecasts, it will rise by more than 100% between 1995 and 2015.
  24.512040211183315
That is why it is important and urgent that we concern ourselves with the European rail network.
  13.108547117857311
It totals 156 000 kilometres in length, of which 78 000 km are accounted for by the TEN network.
  14.741981365307373
12 600 km of new lines for speeds of over 250 km/h should be constructed by 2010, with at least 16 300 km of lines due to be upgraded for speeds of over 200 km/h. The total costs - and they are huge - are estimated at EUR 186 billion between now and 2010.
  19.11510556864211
So it is obvious how important this investment is for the European Union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities quickly.
  14.977044029408356
I think that it is high time we adapted the railways to the market economy, so as to ensure that the railways invest more money more often in customer requirements and that we can jointly set the priorities and draw up a tight, efficient timetable.
  18.31970410600319
The main requirements are, of course, to harmonise the gauge throughout Europe, especially where more than two countries cooperate.
  15.310365687175787
At the moment, we still have five different gauges.
  9.715604887895346
We need uniform electrification, especially in relation to voltage and frequency.
  19.135351691231406
In other words, the technical properties of the electricity must be brought into line so that extra electricity can be bought from the national grids and fed into the national grids without any significant losses.
  13.444524192827792
The third, and I think the most important point is the safety of trains.
  15.347170382928645
We really do need external inspection and certification agencies.
  7.563390360159985
We cannot have a situation in which the agency operating the railway is also responsible for inspecting it.
  13.593904694252364
No-one questions the fact that cars and lorries are inspected by external certification agencies.
  20.30350982936115
I think there is an urgent need, given the recent train crashes, for external inspection agencies to look after the safety of passengers in Europe.
  15.408263430968681
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank all the Members who supported the rapporteur in his work in presenting these two reports which are, I believe, absolutely crucial to the future of the railways.
  12.873412173428449
What is the subject matter?
  15.01476516641796
The first report analyses the application of the 1996 Directive on the interoperability of the high-speed rail system, drawing the lessons of this for the future.
  13.28432465875365
Next, and this is the substance of the second report, we must discuss and vote on a proposed directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system.
  18.790954704437798
Ladies and gentlemen, we must appreciate the full importance of this subject.
  15.71769153992927
There is today an unacceptable contradiction between what is said in speeches and the reality of European transport systems.
  15.819371497078166
As might have been expected, the creation of the internal market has, logically, considerably developed the trade in goods and the mobility of persons within the Union, which have shown an increase of 21% and 15% respectively between 1990 and 1997.
  16.23336186278324
The bulk of the traffic from this explosive growth in internal mobility, which is expected to be consolidated in the next few decades, has been acquired by road systems and, secondarily, maritime cabotage via the North Sea.
  19.142896139979094
At a time when we have right here, in most of the countries of the Union, a rail network and technology unparalleled in the world, with a recent study evaluating the external costs of road transport in terms of public health, infrastructure and pollution at some EUR 480 billion, even though the objective of sustainable mobility and respect for quality of life are now shared by all Europeans, it can be noted that rail has only an 8.6% market share for freight, and 5.8% for passenger transport.
  17.762335799397768
There is more than one explanation for this paradox: rail' s reduced level of competitiveness due to a social differential in relation to the road sector, but also the distortions of competition engendered by the considerable external costs of road transport, the priority which most major railway companies in recent years have given exclusively to prestigious high-speed passenger transport, but also excessive national characteristics in terms of railway traditions, techniques and protocols, thereby compromising the flow of continental rail traffic.
  19.988430112615475
Today, the situation of the European transport network situation is simple to the point of caricature: there is only one common area in transport and that is the road network.
  23.464025910075176
There is no longer any single airspace or European maritime area, nor especially a continuous railway area within the countries of the Union.
  10.581082233943983
The issue at stake in railway interoperability is, of course, doing away with the technical frontiers that have been inherited from the national railway structures set in place gradually since the nineteenth century.
  16.31293082809486
Today, the Europe of the Fifteen has no less than sixteen electric signalling systems, six electrical voltages, five track gauges and several equipment and therefore infrastructure gauges.
  18.271007019753906
Of course, the new high-speed train infrastructures offer a prime area for the introduction of interoperability, since they are new or recent networks devoted to very similar technology.
  12.622189182506617
Directive 96/48 was adopted for this purpose.
  14.103513173144073
The report on its application, four years on, referred to Parliament to express an opinion, delivers contrasting results, but results that are in the end more positive than they may seem.
  12.731653308771664
In the first place, significant delay is observed in the transposition of laws and regulations since, to date, only two countries have transposed it and the first technical specifications for interoperability are on the point of being completed and published.
  14.785316239790937
The conclusion is therefore that the time limits for transposition and publication must be more stringent in future.
  18.912150363394723
This delay in transposing into law has not, however, hindered the development of interoperable cross-border lines, although Thalys is the only example of true interoperability, more so than even Eurostar, despite its attempts to solve the gauge problem.
  23.63510575012636
These two international lines have established a precedent which can serve as a model for future developments.
  15.655926155318737
More than that, however, in anticipation of tangible results in future, the directive on the interoperability of high-speed routes has primarily made it possible to define and iron out working methods.
  12.804142117482357
For the first time, the railway industry, rail companies and infrastructure managers have started up a joint project to define the technical specifications for interoperability.
  15.4428026019118
They have worked on the basis of the most general studies by the International Union of Railways.
  12.731930093130945
Within the European Association for Railway Interoperability (EARI) they have set up a working group which now has methods and experience available for transposition to conventional systems.
  21.170161946047546
Finally, the Committee established by Article 21, bringing together representatives of the Member States and the Commission, enables political and technical monitoring of interoperability projects and intervention at the discretion of states to direct such projects.
  17.17122845025039
In other words, while the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism felt bound to remind the Member States of their obligations in terms of time limits and transposition, it must be admitted that the high-speed systems have provided a first-rate testing ground for the vast worksite of interoperability.
  17.716833224482688
In this respect, we have to bear in mind that the network and the conventional stock present problems for harmonisation that are formidable in other ways, due to the national and historical characteristics of networks, the great diversity of the stock, and the considerable extent of the networks.
  14.935678872882859
It must be made quite clear at this point that there is no question of insisting that rail companies and infrastructure managers immediately proceed to replace their equipment comprehensively. This is totally out of reach, economically.
  18.291229281658524
In the first place, if the goal is to achieve interoperability, this must entail using the fastest and least costly means to achieve decisive progress.
  21.578548520225265
In this respect, interoperability may be achieved by methods other than the harmonisation of equipment, since it is possible to adapt equipment to operate in different configurations, following the example of the quadruple-system locomotives.
  17.075992629817808
This is a proposal for a pragmatic and realistic approach which would not detract from railways' competitiveness in relation to other modes of transport by imposing additional costs.
  19.841425665712052

  1.0

  1.0
The key principles of this proposed directive are as follows: restriction of the geographical area covered by conventional system interoperability to the trans-European network as defined by the 1996 European Parliament and Council Decision; a policy of gradual convergence rather than systematic renewal, taking the form of phasing in priorities and interoperability, establishing a hierarchy for subsystems to enable the fastest and cheapest access, with priority only to new investment for creating, extending, renewing, maintaining and operating systems; establishing a hierarchy of objectives, distinguishing across-the-board objectives to be included in all standards: safety, reliability, health, environmental protection and technical compatibility; the objectives inherent in each technical subsystem: infrastructure, energy, rolling stock, etc.; the separation of the technical task of framing the TSIs assigned to a joint representative body, from the standardisation work entrusted to the European standards institutes, and the inspection and certification entrusted to notified bodies; a policy of user consultation, as suggested by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism which cannot be envisaged, ladies and gentlemen, without concomitant consultation of staff representatives, the subject of an amendment that we shall be discussing tomorrow; finally, ongoing monitoring of these projects by the Member States and the Commission through the Committee established under Article 21, implemented by the high-speed directive, enabling states to request exemptions, to include special cases in the technical specifications for purely historic or regional networks, as well as certain types of equipment originating from third countries, and also instruments for authorising commissioning operations notified by Member States to the Commission.
  19.382189586457667

  1.0
In other words, there are safety valves for countries with a high level of special characteristics, and, within the institutions stipulated by the directive, they still have the opportunity to argue the case for these special characteristics and to have them included in the studies and in the TSI publications.
  15.363321065104865
Finally, during the transition period, it is important to prevent the networks from growing further apart.
  14.058667063616005
To this end, new investments, between now and the publication of the TSIs, shall have to comply with authorised technical references.
  28.852195372160903
A Union rolling-stock register will be set up, making it possible to identify the rolling stock, its renewal and ageing, in the same way that this is still carried out, albeit imperfectly, for the maritime fleet.
  14.524487212658174
Furthermore, we have to look to the future and, therefore, both the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have proposed involving candidate country representatives in the projects at this early stage, so that they can anticipate this future acquis communautaire.
  20.436113809191095
Similarly, and this is a recommendation that we make, we should already be planning conditions of interoperability between the various modes of transport, in accordance with our general objective of developing intermodal interoperability.
  15.385925798577881
It would, of course, be presumptuous to expect everything to be achieved by this directive and the long-term upgrading work it requires from railway operators.
  18.796893393682144
Quite clearly Europe is proposing to undertake a long-term and very large-scale project throughout its vast railway network.
  11.93240560862848
It cannot single-handedly solve the problem of distortions of competition or of network access or charges which would represent crucial progress towards a new golden age of rail in Europe.
  14.471233872768067
All the same, the technical interoperability of our old national networks is indeed an essential condition for the recovery of rail, which this balanced, reasonable and flexible text should make possible to achieve in gradual phases under acceptable economic and social conditions.
  20.389986148367562
To the many of you who contributed to this, let me reiterate my gratitude and my appreciation.
  11.98209055286944
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Savary, and all the members involved for their excellent and constructive cooperation on this difficult, purely technical subject.

The number of proposed amendments tabled, including here in plenary, shows how important this issue is for Europe, which is why I can also praise the Commission for addressing the subject of the interoperability of conventional trains as well as of high-speed trains.
  17.593315617963295
I think it is a pity that few Member States have transposed the interoperability directive with regard to high-speed trains and I call on the Commission to exert pressure to prevent the loss of valuable time which is costing the railways in terms of market shares and competition.
  20.010128844245457
The directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned.
  11.421517282116902
The aim of the directive - as with high-speed trains - is to harmonise technical provisions in order to ensure that conventional rail traffic within the Union runs as smoothly as possible and to give candidate countries really exact specifications so that through traffic is also guaranteed after enlargement.
  18.92515050054386
Interoperability will also have many advantages for both passengers and freight transport.
  18.063982146140848
Better services, greater comfort, less travelling time, increased safety and possibly also lower prices.
  26.26459793427958
The harmonisation of technical standards is also needed for the long overdue liberalisation of the railways.
  16.127006984453867
Both together, interoperability and liberalisation, are most important if the railways are to survive in the internal market.
  15.76005764301946
I am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good, common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that.
  19.57757239422153
This applies above all to the initially highly disputed derogations from the TSIs, but also to the social dimension of this directive, where we were finally able to achieve a compromise.
  18.20282637742213
Nonetheless, - and we in the group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats continue to believe that we are right here - generally-worded social aspects do not belong in this purely technical directive, even if the Commission and the Council may think otherwise.
  18.055491036232922
We are likewise opposed to involving passengers in working out TSIs.
  12.08583445882535
Including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage.
  16.445717777061162
Finally, a few other proposed amendments have been tabled, which we consider are quite simply too bureaucratic and have no positive aspects to boot.
  17.212817878807844
In short, our group is against any elements which are counterproductive when it comes to achieving the important objective of an efficient European railway, as outlined above.
  17.974324028875696
Allow me in closing to highlight the excellent cooperation once again; I am optimistic that together we shall achieve the objective of creating as smooth a railway system as possible.
  12.853043985280078
) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Savary on his drafting of such excellent reports.
  13.863605322832626
This is an important topic, but also an extremely complicated one.
  14.635132642859016
Mr Savary has taken good account of the views of others.
  10.899435356977861
My group supports improvement of the competitiveness of railways and liberalisation of competition.
  13.599095899047256
The first stage is to create the conditions for uninterrupted movement of trains over the entire region of the European Union.
  17.348865981802614
Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) and common standards are a sine qua non for the development of railway interoperability.
  13.963466603758727
The rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach.
  9.827716157536278
Technical solutions can vary a great deal.
  7.471804815771426
The competitiveness of railways should not be undermined by the imposition of additional economic burdens, even though common standards will lower costs in the longer term.
  12.507780735896015
Existing differences between national railway systems will make necessary some exceptions in the harmonisation of railway systems, so that no Member State shall have to face inordinate difficulties and so that current railway transport will not be jeopardised.
  17.540636340295762
This report outlines a course of action by which these exceptions can be accepted without jeopardising the principal objective.
  10.666467561416145
There is one further matter which would require fine tuning; this was outlined in Amendment No 35 by my Group.
  20.519050404929967
It applies to Finland in particular, but some of the applicant countries will be faced with the same problem in connection with enlargement of the Union.
  21.930529660151716
The matter referred to concerns Russian freight wagons, where technical solutions are applied which differ from those of the Member States, inter alia in the area of couplings and brakes.
  15.27267459916975
They are not necessarily inferior, but different.
  8.80291971350219
Russia is hardly about to change its standards in order to comply with the requirements of the Union.
  12.264634687636317
For Finland, this is an exceptionally major issue.
  12.774492149638187
Due to historical reasons, the track gauge in Finland and Russia is the same, but it is different from that in Europe in general.
  19.299964419471696
Russian wagons account for approximately 40 % - almost a half - of Finnish freight transport.
  13.734994143243014
The reason for this high percentage is that we do not want to take the risk of sending Finnish wagons to Russia, since experience shows that they are so very rarely returned.
  17.08237007300749
Russia, of course, is a country which leans heavily on rail transport, with a rolling stock which must equal that of the entire region of the EU put together
  14.139551251047354
In the review concerning point 5 of Article 5, Mr Savary proposes that when considering special cases, particular attention should be paid to the rolling stock of third countries.
  12.822530060071497
This proposal is very good, but the solution remains half-finished, as far as Finland is concerned.
  11.205964258214905
It will lead to unnecessary and laborious inspections of Russian wagons and to massive bureaucracy.
  18.860854040852196
There is no certainty either that Russian wagons in all instances would be regarded as special cases.
  14.325796659433742
This is why we have tabled an amendment of Article 7, which simply aims at making it possible to use third country freight wagons for traffic, as long as they do not cross the border between two Member States.
  17.653252241776826
This is the addition referred to as point f in the Committee' s amendment. Implementation of this proposal would give assurance that rail traffic in Finland could continue without becoming drastically reduced.
  20.913339421897312
Mr President, Environment Commissioner, I am pleased that you are here because we can now address this matter straight away.
  25.093516887601456
We are evidently debating a highly technical subject matter, namely the interoperability of both high-speed and conventional rail systems.
  16.229099545891327
This gives me the opportunity to make a few comments on the environmental dimension to this proposal.
  22.524398608893392
Today, we are essentially witnessing one of many historic moments which those who work in the sector, as well as those who are in favour of trains, have waited for for a long time, because at the end of the day, all this is, of course, meant to culminate in technological harmonisation, which entails the harmonisation of international rail, labour organisations, train drivers who have to make international rail journeys, etc. This also means that employers' organisations and trade unions will have an entirely different role and outlook with respect to this work.
  20.165806254868038
In short, the proposal has a knock-on effect on many other areas and it will be some time before it is a reality.
  20.031443835405796
Certainly if I look at the high-speed link and its technical specifications, I share Mr Savary' s view - who has drawn up an excellent report - that it is scandalous that three, nearly four years after the previous directive on interoperability of the high-speed link, we are still waiting for technical specifications for interoperability.
  21.590827141685484
This does not bode well at all for the future.
  16.578947156839597
What we are aiming for in the long run with this rail proposal is to attempt to cut down on traffic jams but also, more importantly, to benefit the environment, safety and a number of other aspects.
  19.296583372880157
It has to be said, and I have already mentioned this several times within other fora, that the rail system is gradually losing its environmental edge, not so much because it does not take any initiatives itself, but more so because we ourselves prescribe few, if any, specifications for example, regarding the use of diesel-electric locomotives, the type of electricity used, etc.
  15.979093972308949
What we would like, and this is why we welcome with open arms the dual speed for technical specification requirements, is for this technical specification to at least take account of energy consumption and air pollution, something which will require a great deal of hard work.
  19.61497156266075
The second important point is of course the social dimension, as I touched upon a moment ago.
  17.777893284055516
I regret that we are confining ourselves to the bare minimum, i.e. working conditions.
  9.954891004366091
We refer to a social dialogue but we should really take it one step further, because this affects the entire labour organisation of railways.
  19.794875700328625
I would urge you to look into the positive experiences which certain countries have had in changing the labour organisation of the rail system, in order to bring about a more efficient rail system and to set up exchange programmes, so that we can learn from experiences in countries which have struggled in the past, and which are often still struggling where other elements of the rail dossier are concerned, such as liberalisation or fair pricing.
  17.300517404485035
Mr President, despite European integration, the rail system is disintegrating.
  16.042305534259846
It is increasingly hard to obtain international rail timetables and it is often the case that train tickets to remote destinations have to be bought outside the country of departure.
  25.2046307374576
Not so long ago, it was possible to take a direct train from Cologne to Athens, from Paris to Lisbon or from Amsterdam to Copenhagen.
  12.936175189042604
This is now a thing of the past.
  7.1696784407089975
Meanwhile, railways are, however, in the process of being re-discovered.
  13.686617002222793
The times when trains were seen as a burden inherited from the nineteenth century, something that can be neglected and dismantled, are fortunately over.
  18.024508141600425
Almost everyone admits that trains should once again play a key role in European long-haul transport for people and goods alike.
  15.37239962466434
This is not just necessary to meet the increasing demand for transport options, but mainly to curb the tide of cars and aeroplanes which form a threat to the environment.
  17.338328463572246
The views on how to modernise the rail system are strongly divided.
  16.151059279128745
For a long time, it was fashionable to apply everything that had contributed to the emergence of cars and aeroplanes to trains.
  10.371929817889997
According to this line of thinking, everything should come down in price and should become flexible, so that price-based competition has a less detrimental effect on trains.
  11.692835212627898
Some people still advocate that everything should be privatised and liberalised, that the influence of trade unions must be restrained and that railway personnel should perform more work for lower wages.
  18.92048043929626
According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, these remedies are worse than the disease.
  19.95619254650238
These would reportedly lead to further decay of the railway business and deterioration in the quality of services, and would force personnel to strike more, for reasons of self-preservation.
  20.459253189963718
The real solutions must be sought in a completely different direction. For starters, there should be better cooperation between the existing national railway companies in the management of frequent and fast cross-border routes.
  15.699455644883455
In the case of the conventional railway system, the routes Brussels to Amsterdam, Hamburg to Copenhagen and Dublin to Belfast are good examples of this.
  15.889846073301591
The passengers are unaware that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and frequent link.
  20.776266920883437
This could also apply to the extensions of the French high-speed links in England, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany which are running under the names "Eurostar" and "Thalys".
  20.695876652845303
To guarantee success, it is important not to bring in a whole ream of new commercial businesses, which would lead to bad connections and variable pricing.
  18.222709912682863
Furthermore, the money to finance such a high-speed network should not be found through cutting down services on short-haul routes in the individual Member States, as many people are indignant - and rightly so - about the huge amount of funding being ploughed into fast connections for the benefit of a small, privileged minority.
  19.293056675704815
The construction of new high-speed links will continue to meet with protest if the ordinary domestic train user only ever experiences higher prices and fewer facilities and if they do not solve the environmental problems caused by cars and aeroplanes.
  19.197443266788554
Needless to say, technology should be better harmonised by means of common mains voltage, joint equipment, fewer changes for passengers at borders and uniform safety requirements.
  20.657192450784223
Privatisation and fragmentation according to the British model offer no guarantee whatsoever that those improvements could be better accommodated than if we were to keep the present state enterprises.
  14.640623188997713
The position of the one million employees in the European rail system must be protected.
  14.380626730089125
